What I have in mind is to create a reimplemented version of the Learning And Reading Assistant, LARA. I am one of the main implementors of the original LARA platform. Discussing this with other members of the LARA community, there is great interest in the idea of reimplementing it in this way.\n\nDoes this in principle sound like a possible plan?",
