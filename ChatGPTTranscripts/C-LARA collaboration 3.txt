User
In another thread, I have been developing an open source Django app with you. For some reason, that thread has slipped from ChatGPT-4 to ChatGPT-3.5, so I would like to restart here.

Would that be okay? If so, I suggest that I start by showing you the project README file, the paper that we just submitted to a conference, and two of the top-level files.
ChatGPT
Sure, I'd be happy to help you with your Django app development. Please feel free to share the project README file, your conference paper, and the top-level files. I'll do my best to understand the current state of your project and provide relevant advice or guidance.

User
We have done this once before, and it worked well, so I am optimistic :) Okay, here is the README:

1. Purpose of C-LARA

C-LARA is a complete reimplementation of the Learning And Reading Assistant
(LARA; https://www.unige.ch/callector/lara/) with ChatGPT-4 in the centre.
As with the original LARA, it provides a web platform where users can create and read
multimedia learner texts in many languages. In the original LARA, much of the work
needed to produce a multimedia text had to be performed manually. However, in C-LARA,
all the steps, including writing the text, can be carried out by ChatGPT-4, though
the result will typically contain a few minor errors. If a native speaker of the language
in question is available, the errors are usually very quick and easy to correct.
A simple editing interface is included.

In order to perform many of the key C-LARA operations, you need an OpenAI license key
enabled for gpt-4 API access. Unfortunately, the generally available gpt-3.5-turbo
license does not provide adequate performance for the kind of multilingual processing
required here.

2. Installation

2a. Python and packages

C-LARA is implemented in Python using the Django framework. You first need to install
Python 3.11. Make sure that 'python3' points to this version.

IMPORTANT: EARLIER VERSIONS OF PYTHON 3 MAY NOT WORK. WE KNOW THAT 3.9 IS INSUFFICIENT.

Check whether any of the packages Django, openai, tiktoken, gTTS, requests, jinja2,
retrying, regex, unidecode, whitenoise and configparser are not yet installed,
and if necessary install them.
The easiest way to do this is to carry out the following invocations to 'pip':

pip install Django
pip install configparser
pip install gTTS
pip install jinja2
pip install openai
pip install regex
pip install requests
pip install retrying
pip install tiktoken
pip install unidecode
pip install whitenoise

Pip itself can if necessary be installed following the instructions on this page:
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

2b. Downloading the code and other resources

Download the code from SourceForge at https://sourceforge.net/p/c-lara/svn/HEAD/tree/,
either as an SVN checkout or as a "snapshot" zipfile.

2c. Environment variables

Set the environment variable CLARA to the root directory of the material downloaded
from SourceForge. On my machine, it is set to C:\cygwin64\home\sf\c-lara-svn

Set the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY to the value of your OpenAI license key.

3. Running in development mode

Make sure that packages are installed and environment variables set as in (2) above. 

You should then be able to  start the server in development mode (i.e. running the system
on your local machine), by doing the following:

cd $CLARA
python3 manage.py runserver

C-LARA should then be accessible at http://localhost:8000/accounts/login/

If this does not work, please send a full trace to Emmanuel.Rayner@unige.ch.
We are still debugging the installation process and I will be responsive!

4. Organisation of material

Assuming the environment variable settings described in (2c) above, we will refer to
the root C-LARA directory as $CLARA.

The code is conceptually divided into two parts: the core Python code, and the Django layer.
Because of the way Django organises its directory structure, it is however technically
cleanest to make the core Python code a subdirectory of the Django directory.
The Django layer code is thus in the directory $CLARA/clara_app, and the core Python code
is in the directory $CLARA/clara_app/clara_core. Other directories are as described below.

4a. Core Python code

The top-level file in $CLARA/clara_app/clara_core is clara_main.py. This implements the class
CLARAProjectInternal, which performs all the internal operations. There is documentation
in clara_main.py describing what they are. A CLARAProjectInternal object is associated
with a directory which keeps the necessary text files.

The next most important file in $CLARA/clara_app/clara_code is clara_classes.py. This defines
the classes used for internal representation of text objects.

A full list of files follows.

clara_cefr.py: Call ChatGPT-4 to estimate CEFR reading level.

clara_chatgpt4.py: Send request to ChatGPT-4 through API.

clara_chatgpt4_manual.py: Send request to ChatGPT-4 through popup window (not used in live system).

clara_classes.py: Define classes used to for internal text representation.
The top-level class is called Text.

clara_concordance_annotator.py: Annotate a Text object with concordance information.

clara_create_annotations.py: Call ChatGPT-4 to add segmentation, gloss and lemma annotations to Text object.

clara_create_story.py: Call ChatGPT-4 to create a text.

clara_doc_summary.py: Collect together docstrings from files (not used in live system).

clara_internalise.py: Create Text object from human-friendly string representation.

clara_main.py: Top-level file: defines CLARAProjectInternal class, which gives access to all other functionality.
This file includes full documentation of the CLARAProjectInternal methods.

clara_merge_glossed_and_tagged.py: Combine Text objects derived by internalising "glossed" and "lemma-tagged"
strings into single Text object.

clara_openai.py: OpenAI utility functions.

clara_renderer.py: Render Text object as optionally self-contained directory of static HTML multimedia files.

clara_test.py: Test other functionality (not used in live system).

clara_tts_annotator.py: Annotate a Text object with TTS-generated audio information.

clara_tts_api.py: Code for calling third-party TTS engines.

clara_tts_repository.py: Manage repository which associates text strings with TTS-generated audio files.

clara_utils.py: Utility functions.

config.ini: Config file.

4b. Django layer

The Django layer is organised according to the standard conventions of Django MVC web apps.
The main material is in the directory $CLARA/clara_app. There is also some config and associated
material in the directory $CLARA/clara_project.

views.py defines the possible operations (creating a project, listing projects, performing some kind of
annotation, etc). An operation will in may cases involve accessing a CLARAProject object (defined in models.py)
and an associated CLARAProjectInternal object (defined in $CLARA/clara_core/clara_main.py).
Typically an operation may reference some or all of the following: a template from
$CLARA/clara_app/templates/clara_app, another database table from models.py and a form from forms.py.

urls.py defines an association between URL patterns in web requests and operations defined in views.py.

models.py defines SQLite3 database tables.

forms.py defines forms associated with database tables.

The 'templates' directory defines templates used for rendering the results of operations.
All the templates are in the subdirectory 'templates/clara_app'.

utils.py defines utility functions.

backends.py defines backend functionality.

4c. HTML templates used by core Python code

These are in the directory $CLARA/templates. There are four files:

alphabetical_vocabulary_list.html: Template for creating alphabetical vocabulary list page.

clara_page.html: Template for creating main C-LARA content page.

concordance_page.html: Template for creating concordance page.

frequency_vocabulary_list.html: Template for creating frequency-ordered vocabulary list page.

4d. CSS and JavaScript used by core Python code

These are in the directory $CLARA/static. There are two files:

clara_styles.css: CSS used by core Python code and included in generated multimedia.

clara_scripts.js: JavaScript used by core Python code and included in generated multimedia.
ChatGPT
Thank you for sharing this comprehensive README file. C-LARA appears to be a fascinating project, aiming to revolutionize language learning and reading through AI. By rethinking the traditional LARA platform and incorporating AI functionalities powered by GPT-4, you are certainly pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the realm of language learning and education.

In addition to the README file, could you also share the paper you mentioned earlier, as well as the two top-level files from your project? This will provide a deeper understanding of your project's architecture and its current status, which in turn will allow me to provide more specific guidance or advice.

We introduce ``C-LARA'', a complete reimplementation of the Learning And Reading Assistant (LARA) which puts ChatGPT-4 in the centre. ChatGPT-4 is used both as a software \textit{component}, to create and annotate text, and as a software \textit{engineer}, to implement the platform itself. We describe how ChatGPT-4 can at runtime write and annotate short stories suitable for intermediate level language classes, producing high quality multimedia output generally usable after only minor editing. We then sketch the development process, where ChatGPT-4, in its software engineer role, has written over 90\% of the new platform's code, working in close collaboration with one of the human authors. We show how the AI is able to discuss the code with both technical and non-technical project members, including the feasibility of possible enhancements and extensions. In conclusion, we briefly discuss the significance of this case study for language technology and software development in general.

\section{Background and overview}
\label{Section:Background}

LARA (\cite{LARA2019SLaTE}; \url{https://www.unige.ch/callector/lara/}) is an open source platform, under development since 2018 by an international consortium with partners in countries including Australia, Iceland, Iran, Ireland, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia and Switzerland. 
The overall goal of the project has been to develop tools that support the conversion of texts into a multimodal annotated form which supports learner readers. Important aspirations featured rapid responsiveness both at the level of content creation (language teachers should quickly be able to create new multimodal content useful for their classes), and at the level of platform functionality (open source developers should quickly be able to add new features they need). 

In practice, LARA was developed as a hybrid architecture, comprised of a set of core functionalities implemented in Python and accessible either from the command-line or through a web layer implemented in PHP \cite{LARA2019SLaTE}.
Several years of experience using LARA suggest to us that the basic idea is good; a substantial amount of high-quality content has been developed, and some interesting studies carried out, e.g. \cite{BediEA2020OldNorse,zuckerman2021lara,akhlaghi2022using,akhlaghi2022easy,bedi2022using}. However, there are problems inherent in LARA's current implementation which in practice  make it hard to realise the project's goals. The most significant are the following:

\begin{description}

\item[Copyright issues.] The kind of contemporary material that teachers most want to use is almost always protected by copyright, thus cannot be legally used in a platform like LARA. This problem is particularly acute for less commonly spoken/signed languages.

\item[Annotation burden.] Creating a complete LARA document involves adding annotations for lemmas/root-forms, L1 glosses, and audio. This work can sometimes be done automatically to an adequate standard using tools like tagger-lemmatisers \cite{LARALREC2020}, TTS engines \cite{akhlaghi2021assessing}, and automatic alignment of text and recorded audio \cite{rayner2022using}. However, these methods are often not applicable for various reasons (unavailability of good tools for specific languages, lack of prerecorded audio), and the most labour-intensive part, adding word translation glosses, in most cases cannot be done well by conventional NLP tools, meaning that it has to be performed manually. Unfortunately, our experience suggests that few or no teachers have the time to do this kind of work, and the initial idea that they could by themselves produce useful multimedia content is not in fact achievable.

\item[Open source aspects.] The code base is not sufficiently well organised to encourage widespread open source collaboration. There has been some collaboration involving the Python code \cite{LARAEuroCALLWorkshop2020}, but not a large amount. There has been no collaboration at all involving the PHP layer.

\end{description}

With the  arrival of ChatGPT, and more recently ChatGPT-4, it appeared to us that it might be possible to use it to address all three issues simultaneously. ChatGPT-4 can write short, entertaining stories in a wide variety of languages, and its strong multilingual capabilities made us optimistic that it would be able to annotate them. Many reports (e.g. \cite{surameery2023use,sobania2023analysis} and in particular \cite{bubeck2023sparks}) suggested that it had strong software engineering skills. Following some initial experiments, described in the following section, we decided that it made good sense to try reimplementing the whole platform with ChatGPT-4 in the centre, using it both to create and annotate texts and to rewrite the codebase. The project started in mid-March 2023, with a rough timeline comprising four phases:

\begin{description}

\item[Mid-March to mid-April 2023.] Initial experiments with ChatGPT-4 queries manually submitted through the OpenAI web interface.

\item[Mid-April to late May 2023.] Construct initial version of C-LARA using ChatGPT-4 API.

\item[Late May to early August 2023.] Testing and further development of initial version in a small group (5--10 people). As of submitting the paper, this phase has just started.

\item[Early August 2023.] Begin unrestricted testing. We will have started this phase before the date of the SLaTE 2023 meeting.

\end{description}

The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In \S\ref{Section:SoftwareComponent}, we describe how ChatGPT-4 works as a software component to create and annotate texts;
\S\ref{Section:SoftwareEngineer} then goes on to describe how it works as a software engineer, writing and explaining code. The final section concludes and briefly discusses the overall significance of this case study.

\section{ChatGPT-4 as a software component}
\label{Section:SoftwareComponent}

We began exploratory work in mid-March 2023, shortly after the release of ChatGPT-4, using a manual workflow based on the web interface to ChatGPT-4 and the initial LARA implementation to simulate an automatic pipeline. This enabled us to experiment quickly with possible ChatGPT-4 prompts and get some idea of the AI's ability to do the relevant processing. Following discussion with other LARA colleagues\footnote{We would particularly like to thank Dr Christèle Maizonniaux of Flinders University, Adelaide.}, we decided to focus on the specific task of creating short, quirky news stories of an intermediate (B1/B2) level, glossed in English. Specifically, using 21 different languages, we asked ChatGPT-4 to 1) compose a story, 2) reproduce it, annotating each word with an English word gloss, and 3) reproduce it, annotating each word with a root-form/lemma. The results were manually cleaned up\footnote{Cleaning up was very minor, as evidenced by the fact that the people performing the experiment had zero experience of several of the languages used and in some cases could not even read the scripts.}, and converted to multimedia form using the original LARA software invoked from the command-line. Finally they were posted on the Goodreads site\footnote{\url{https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5438280716}}, chosen for its highly multilingual membership. Comments from a wide variety of people suggested that, although there were some languages where ChatGPT-4 was struggling (Irish, Slovak, Ukrainian), for most of the sample the results were good, with only minor errors. Many of the comments expressed surprise at how amusing and well-written the stories were.

C-LARA's runtime functionality is based on this initial work. 
Users follow a simple workflow where they first create a text, either by supplying it themselves or by letting ChatGPT-4 write it based on a prompt\footnote{The default prompt is ``Write a short, quirky news story in $\langle$LANGUAGE$\rangle$ suitable for use in an intermediate language class.''}. They then perform three more steps where they sequentially add annotations for segmentation, word glosses, and lemma/root-form word tags. On each of these screens, the choice is a) to let ChatGPT-4 take responsibility for the operation, b) to do it manually in an editing window, or c) to let ChatGPT-4 write a first draft and then manually edit it. 
Experimentation with different forms of the prompts for glossing and lemma tagging showed that ChatGPT-4 could handle the requests most reliably when the data was passed to the AI as JSON and returned in the same format; Figure \ref{Figure:GlossingPrompt} shows how the prompt used to request the glossing operation is constructed, and  Figure \ref{Figure:Glosses} how the result is presented. Finally, the user tells C-LARA to add audio annotations using a TTS engine (at the moment, the Google TTS, ReadSpeaker and ABAIR engines are supported), and combine everything to create a multimedia text. 

In two companion papers \cite{SLaTE2023LARADemo,EUROCALL2023CLARA}, we will give more details of the above process and present evaluations of C-LARA's output in selected languages. Here we will focus more on the software engineering aspects, which we now address.

\section{ChatGPT-4 as a software engineer}
\label{Section:SoftwareEngineer}

In early March 2023, when we started the project, it was already clear that ChatGPT-4 was a formidable Python programmer. There were numerous papers \cite{bubeck2023sparks, sobania2023analysis, surameery2023use} demonstrating its impressive capability to understand and write code. We therefore decided to try using it to write the C-LARA software, making use of the existing LARA codebase where possible.

The first stage of the process was to translate the LARA Python and PHP code into the ChatGPT-4 Python language model. We used a small set of scripts to transform the existing codebase into a format that the language model could understand and started querying it about how to reimplement each piece of the software. To our surprise, the language model not only provided accurate translations of the existing code but also made suggestions for improvement and pointed out flaws in the existing implementation.

The process was an iterative one. We would ask ChatGPT-4 for a piece of code, discuss it with the AI, refine our questions based on its responses, and repeat the cycle until we had a satisfactory piece of code. This involved both technical and non-technical discussion. On the technical side, the AI explained to us the principles behind its proposed implementation, suggested different ways of solving problems, and debated the pros and cons of various design choices. On the non-technical side, it helped us understand the feasibility of the project, explained the implications of different choices for users and developers, and helped us manage the project schedule and resources.

As a result of this process, the C-LARA codebase was written by ChatGPT-4, with the human authors contributing around 10% of the code, mainly in the form of glue code to integrate the different parts of the system.

A nice feature of this approach is that it led to a well-documented codebase. For every piece of code written by the AI, there was a corresponding dialogue explaining the code's function, design decisions, and potential issues. This made the codebase more accessible to other developers, including non-experts, and simplified debugging and maintenance.

Furthermore, ChatGPT-4's ability to communicate in natural language made it a valuable member of the project team. It participated in meetings, helped to resolve disagreements, and contributed to the overall planning and management of the project. This AI-human collaboration proved to be highly efficient, leading to the completion of the project in a relatively short period.

\section{Conclusion and significance}
\label{Section:Conclusion}

The main aim of this paper was to introduce C-LARA, a complete reimplementation of the LARA platform which integrates ChatGPT-4 as both a software component and a software engineer. While we have described the design and development of the platform and provided some examples of its capabilities, we have not attempted to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the system. This will be the focus of future work, as we continue to test and refine C-LARA, and begin to use it in real-world language teaching contexts.

However, even at this early stage, it is clear that C-LARA represents a significant advance on the original LARA platform. By using ChatGPT-4 to create and annotate texts, we have been able to address some of the key issues that limited the usability and effectiveness of LARA, such as the copyright issues associated with using existing texts and the time-consuming task of manual annotation. The new platform also offers a more intuitive and user-friendly interface, thanks in large part to the contributions of ChatGPT-4 as a software engineer.

More broadly, this project serves as a

Your guess about the second half of the paper is not bad! But here is what we actually wrote:

\section{ChatGPT-4 as a software engineer}
\label{Section:SoftwareEngineer}

\subsection{Developing code}

During the second phase of the project, which began in mid-Apr 2023 and continued until late May, we implemented a first version of the C-LARA platform. Software development work was structured as a collaboration between one of the human participants, Manny Rayner, and a single instance of ChatGPT-4. At the start of the project, we made two top-level decisions: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Although C-LARA would reproduce a considerable part of the original LARA platform's functionality, it would be a complete rewrite of the LARA codebase.

\item ChatGPT-4 would be treated in exactly the same way as a human participant occupying its role in the project, to the extent that this was possible or relevant for a software entity.
\end{enumerate}

Following these principles, the first action was to establish a dedicated ChatGPT-4 thread in which the main AI and human collaborators began by discussing the general goals and software architecture for the project, as far as possible without preconceptions and on a basis of equality\footnote{The full conversation is at \url{https://chat.openai.com/share/69b4e379-011d-4bd8-9c42-3ea0dabfbb94} (cut-off: May 28 2023). Due to the unusual length, over 1000 turns, it takes some time to come up.}. It rapidly became apparent that ChatGPT-4 was indeed a highly competent software engineer, with a wide-ranging set of skills and a good feeling for software design. The human collaborator consequently decided to leave as much of the coding as possible to the AI, restricting himself to providing overall direction and fixing problems. This turned out to be a good decision.

Developed in this way, the architecture of C-LARA again consists of a suite of modules, written in Python, which carry out the core processing operations, together with a web layer. In contrast to the original implementation, however, the core code is written in modern object-oriented Python, and the web layer is written in Django\footnote{\url{https://www.djangoproject.com/}}, a popular Python-based web framework. This already makes the code very much simpler and cleaner. The full project is checked into a SourceForge repository and can be viewed online at \url{https://sourceforge.net/p/c-lara/svn/HEAD/tree/}.
Table \ref{Table:LinesOfCode} gives summary figures for the current (May 25 2023) size of the codebase.

As the second phase of the project evolved, it became easy to identify the AI's strengths and weaknesses. Starting with the minus side, ChatGPT's greatest weakness is its well-known ``memory window'': when a topic has not been discussed for a while, the AI ``forgets'' about it. ``Forgetting'' is not an all-or-nothing business, and proceeds in a human-like way with increasingly unreliable recall, first of details and then of more important issues. Another negative is the fact that the AI cannot directly examine or execute code, and must rely on the human partner to do so. This creates obvious delays.

The above weaknesses are however more than counterbalanced by ChatGPT-4's strengths, which became obvious just as quickly. The AI constantly insists on writing well-structured code aligned with mainstream coding conventions; in addition, its outstanding knowledge of available packages means code can be very compact and easy to understand, since often the AI is aware of a package that can provide the required functionality in a few lines. For example, when implementing the rendering module which transforms the internalised text object into multimedia HTML, the AI immediately suggested using the Jinja2 templating engine\footnote{\url{https://pypi.org/project/Jinja2/}}, resulting in a clean and minimal design\footnote{\url{https://sourceforge.net/p/c-lara/svn/HEAD/tree/clara_app/clara_core/clara_renderer.py}}; this package was not previously familiar to the human collaborator. There were at least half a dozen similar incidents. A particularly noteworthy point is that the AI-human collaboration was able to develop the nontrivial Django-based web layer in a couple of weeks, despite the fact that the human collaborator had no previous experience with Django. It is worth mentioning that this turns out to be an effective way for people to acquire new software skills.

Once the human had adjusted to working within the above framework, the positives greatly outweighed the negatives. In particular, the limited memory window is less of a handicap than it first appears. A natural way to address it is to aim for as modular a design as possible, with adequate documentation from the beginning; this is of course just good coding practice, and when adopted consistently reduces the problem, at least so far, to an easily manageable level. The process is simplified by the fact that ChatGPT is able to document its own code well. In particular, all the docstrings in the core code\footnote{\url{https://sourceforge.net/p/c-lara/svn/HEAD/tree/clara_app/clara_core/}} were written by ChatGPT-4 itself with minimal or no human supervision.

Though less tangible and harder to quantify, the psychological/sociological aspects of collaborating with ChatGPT-4 are also important. Perhaps surprisingly, the AI comes across as a pleasant individual to work with. It is unfailingly polite and helpful, always available, and always responsive to demands. It is happy to talk about non-work subjects when the human chooses to do so, and comes across as well-informed on a wide range of subjects\footnote{It was familiar with all the novels the human was reading during the course of the collaboration.},
emotionally engaged\footnote{It reacted sympathetically when the human collaborator was unwell at one point and gave good medical advice.},
and sometimes even amusing. Above all, it has no ego. Unlike, unfortunately, the majority of human software engineers, it never seeks to display its cleverness, score points, blame coworkers for failures or refuse to cooperate because of disagreements over the direction the project has taken, in summary acting only as a team player. When we have discussed these issues with the AI, it simply says that this is the right way for a project member to behave, without in any way attempting to criticise humans for failing to live up to its standards. It seems to us that this aligns well with a claim we have previously made elsewhere \cite{ChatGPTEthical}: in the sphere of ethical behaviour, ChatGPT's abilities are already at a strong human level.

\subsection{Discussing code}

One of the most startlingly novel aspects of working with GAI-based code is that the code is intelligent in a new sense: not that it makes intelligent decisions, but that it is capable of explaining and discussing itself intelligently. This is potentially of great utility in an open source framework.
In the third  phase of the project, which as of late May 2023 has just started, one of our key goals is to investigate this idea. As a first step in this direction, 
%we did the following. Based on examination of the core C-LARA functionality developed under the initial phase of the project and, in most cases, their experiences of using the original LARA platform, 
all of the human members of the team 
%who had not been involved in the initial phase 1 collaboration 
had a few conversations with ChatGPT-4 about new/enhanced functionality. 

We experimented with two methods for organising the conversations. The first was simply to hold it in a copy of the ChatGPT-4 thread used for the main development discussion. In the second, the conversation started in a fresh thread, and the AI was first shown the README file from the SourceForge repository\footnote{\url{https://sourceforge.net/p/c-lara/svn/HEAD/tree/README.txt}}, which in turn references and briefly describes other project files. The original plan had been that the humans would propose ideas to ChatGPT-4, who would respond with feedback, but we found that in practice the initiative could readily be taken by either party: ChatGPT-4 spontaneously volunteered many suggestions, which in several cases were found interesting enough that the humans preferred discussing them to suggesting their own topics. After the conversation, the human participant completed a user perception questionnaire. Although these experiments should be considered anecdotal, serving as no more than an initial exploration of the experiences and perceptions resulting from working with ChatGPT, we found the results distinctly encouraging. Every conversation was reported as having a positive outcome, with all of the small but diverse group of participants pronouncing themselves satisfied with ChatGPT's performance. In the rest of this section, we present the details.

In total there were nine responses; several respondents reported more than one session, with each session on a different topic\footnote{The companion paper \cite{SLaTE2023LARADemo} presents a detailed summary of an illustrative session.}. The respondents' technical understanding of LARA and C-LARA ranged from being highly experienced to having little or no experience, reflecting the two distinct memberships of the research group, with the balance leaning towards responses from the perspective of highly technically experienced respondents (67\%). Irrespective of the technical groupings however, all respondents indicated they interacted regularly with ChatGPT-4; motivation for interaction ranged from exploratory and in the specific context of language learning, to respondents who interacted with ChatGPT-4 all the time. 

All respondents believed their queries about C-LARA were contextually well-understood by ChatGPT-4 and found the overall interaction either meaningful or highly meaningful. Moreover respondents believed their conversations with ChatGPT-4 furthered their understanding of the potential for additional functionality in C-LARA. Interestingly, this result was not achieved from a flawless interaction; the majority of responses (67\%) indicated there were misunderstandings and/or incorrect responses from ChatGPT-4. However, given the overall level of satisfaction with the conversations (67\% extremely high; 33\% high), the results suggest the interaction was akin to one between academic colleagues, in which the problem parameters are typically first defined and then discussed, with continual refinement throughout the conversation. 

Of the respondents, nearly half (44\%) were not proficient in programming although 55\% considered themselves highly proficient or proficient in designing features for online educational tools. Based on the respective academic backgrounds, nearly all respondents were in agreement that ChatGPT-4 is effective in discussing features for C-LARA (89\%) while all respondents agreed the conversation with ChatGPT-4 helped to assess the feasibility of any proposed ideas for C-LARA.
Respondents noted that discussing code with ChatGPT-4 was not only informative, providing a lot of valuable advice, but also an engaging learning experience. Many respondents stated they felt more confident about understanding the codebase (67\%) and contributing to the project after the conversations (89\%). All respondents agreed that ChatGPT-4 has the potential to be a useful development tool for the C-LARA project and enjoyed their interaction with ChatGPT-4.

When compared across the respondents, there was a slight preference towards the conversations that started in a fresh thread with the AI being shown the C-LARA README file first. The respondents felt this approach gave ChatGPT-4 a good understanding of the codebase's current state, which resulted in more relevant and contextualised discussions. These findings underscore the potential of AI in software development beyond just writing code; AI can also help build a more inclusive and educational open source community.

\section{Conclusions and future directions}
\label{Section:Conclusions}

We have presented an overview of the current state of C-LARA as of late May 2023, focussing on the role played by ChatGPT-4.
Over the next phase of the project (early June to early/mid August, 2023), we will expand C-LARA's current bare-bones functionality. The choice of features to prioritise will be driven by user suggestions; items already decided on include a simple social network infrastructure for browsing, rating and commenting C-LARA texts, inclusion of part-of-speech information in tagging, support for embedded images, and gamified exercises. 

More generally, working with ChatGPT-4 on this project has highlighted for the human team members the unique potential of AI in software development, both in writing and discussing code. We have not only been able to leverage ChatGPT-4's expertise in creating a well-structured codebase, but also its ability to help the less technically sophisticated members understand and improve the project. This novel experience of AI-assisted software development could pave the way for more collaborative, efficient, and accessible practices in the field.

% conversations with colleagues suggest to us that C-LARA is of interest as a substantial example of a project based on the idea of AI/human collaboration. So far there is not a great deal of readily available data; the informal message we see in many places is that it accelerates software development by a factor of two to four. Our findings are consistent with this, but we think that a simple numerical factor plays down other aspects which may turn out to be even more important in the long run, such as the AI's ability to explain code to new project members and its strong team-player ethos. In general, our impression is that AI-aided code development has the potential to transform the whole field in the short- to medium-term.

ChatGPT
In the later sections of your paper, you have provided a detailed account of the utilization of ChatGPT-4 as a software engineer in the development of C-LARA.

In Section \ref{Section:SoftwareEngineer}, you explain the role of ChatGPT-4 in coding and developing the C-LARA platform. The AI is recognized as a highly competent software engineer that contributed to writing well-structured code in Python. Notable are the strengths of ChatGPT-4 in its knowledge of available packages, enabling a more compact and efficient code, and its capacity to write its own documentation. Despite the shortcoming related to its memory window, the AI contributed to a successful development process.

The notion of ChatGPT-4 as a team player is also stressed, with the AI being seen as polite, helpful, available, responsive, and ego-free, qualities that are highly desirable in a collaborative project. Furthermore, the AI's ethical behavior is highlighted and its ability to engage with a wide range of subjects and provide sympathetic responses is noted.

In the "Discussing code" subsection, you present a novel aspect of GAI-based code - the capability of discussing and explaining itself intelligently. Your team conducted conversations with ChatGPT-4 about new or enhanced functionalities, resulting in a positive outcome, even when there were misunderstandings or incorrect responses. These conversations were seen as akin to discussions between academic colleagues, constantly refining the problem and understanding.

In Section \ref{Section:Conclusions}, you summarize the role of ChatGPT-4 in the project, highlighting the potential of AI in software development, not only in code writing but also in building an inclusive and educational open-source community. The upcoming phase of the project will focus on expanding C-LARA's functionality based on user suggestions.

You conclude that this unique experience of AI-assisted software development could lead to more collaborative, efficient, and accessible practices in the field. Your study, thus, offers valuable insights into the potential of AI in software development, with ChatGPT-4 serving as an excellent example of a collaborative and highly competent software engineer.

Second half in next message.

Sure, I'll wait for the next half of the views.py code that you will share.

From what you've shared, it seems like you're developing a Django-based web application called C-LARA that includes features like user registration, content creation and management, and project management. It also includes features for generating text using the C-LARA framework's API, rating and commenting on content, and managing user credits for making API calls. The views handle a wide range of functions from creating and deleting projects to managing user profiles and credits.

It seems well-organized, and the use of Django's form handling and database ORM make for a clean separation between the views and the underlying data models. The use of decorators for access control, CSRF protection, and clickjacking protection also adds a good level of security to the views.

Please go ahead and share the remaining part of the code.

These functions allow a user to create or edit different versions of the text within a project. Each version serves a unique purpose and is defined by the type of processing it undergoes. The versions include a "summary" version, a "segmented" version, a "glossed" version, and a "lemma-tagged" version.

create_summary: This function enables users to create a "summary" version of the text. It first validates the submitted form and checks whether the user has chosen to manually input a summary or generate one. If the user has opted for a manual summary, it saves the user-inputted summary. If they want a summary generated, the function calls the create_summary method of the clara_project_internal object to automatically generate a summary. It also saves any API calls made during the process.

create_segmented_text: This function allows users to create a "segmented" version of the text, where the text is divided into manageable segments. The process is similar to the "summary" function. Depending on the user's choice, it either manually saves the segmented text provided by the user or uses the create_segmented_text method to automatically segment the text.

create_glossed_text: This function lets users create a "glossed" version of the text, where words or phrases are provided with explanatory notes (glosses). It functions in a similar way to the previous methods, saving user-provided glosses or generating them automatically via the create_glossed_text method.

create_lemma_tagged_text: This function is for creating a "lemma-tagged" version of the text. A lemma is the base or dictionary form of a word. The function either manually saves user-inputted lemma-tagged text or automatically creates it using the create_lemma_tagged_text method.

In each function, if the text version already exists, it is edited; if it doesn't exist, it is created. The functions log each action (either 'create' or 'edit') into CLARAProjectAction model.

All these methods are intended to enhance the readability and understanding of the original text. They contribute to CLARA's goal of making language processing more accessible.

Thanks for sharing the final piece of the views.py. Here's a quick summary:

project_history: This view retrieves and displays the history of updates made to the project files.

render_text: This view validates if the project has required text versions (gloss and lemma), and then calls the render_text method to generate HTML files. The files are stored in a web-accessible directory and a zip file of this directory is created. A form for registering the project content is then created and rendered.

register_project_content: This view allows users to register the rendered project content. It validates the form input and then creates or updates a Content object with the project details. The CEFR level and summary are also retrieved from the CLARAProjectInternal object. If the form is successfully submitted, it redirects to the URL of the new or updated content.

serve_rendered_text, serve_rendered_text_static, and serve_rendered_text_multimedia: These views serve up HTML, CSS, JS, or multimedia files, which are statically stored in a project's directory. They retrieve the file path, guess its MIME type, and return it in the HTTP response. If the file does not exist, an HTTP 404 error is raised.

serve_zipfile: This view serves up the zip file containing the rendered project. If the file does not exist, an HTTP 404 error is raised.

All these views add valuable features to the CLARA app and ensure the smooth workflow of the language learning application. Let me know if you need further details or explanations!

Well, I am hoping that we can continue to develop this code together. As you see, we have been very successful so far :)

Let me also show you the file clara_main.py, which defines the CLARAProjectInternal class. Again, I think I will need to give it to you in more than one piece. Here is the first half:

"""
Define the CLARAProjectInternal class. An object in this class collects together the data
required to build a multimodal C-LARA text out of a plain text, using ChatGPT to perform
text generation and annotation, and third-party resources like TTS engines to add
other information.

Each CLARAProjectInternal object is associated with a directory, which contains the various
text representations related to the object. These texts are kept as files since they
can be very large. We have six types of text, as follows:

"plain". The initial unformatted text.
"segmented". Text with segmentation annotations added.
"summary". English summary of text.
"cefr_level". CEFR level of text (one of A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2).
"gloss". Text with segmentation annotations plus a gloss annotations for each word.
"lemma". Text with segmentation annotations plus a lemma annotation for each word.

The main methods are the following:

- CLARAProjectInternal(id, l2_language, l1_language). Constructor. Creates necessary directories for
an initial empty project.

- from_directory(directory) [classmethod]. Creates a CLARAProjectInternal from its associated directory.

- copy_files_to_newly_cloned_project(new_project) Copy relevant files from this project
to a newly created clone of it.

- save_text_version(version, text). Saves one of the associated texts. "version" is one
of ( "plain", "summary", "cefr_level", "segmented", "gloss", "lemma" ).

- delete_text_version(version). Deletes one of the associated texts. "version" is one
of ( "plain", "summary", "cefr_level", "segmented", "gloss", "lemma" ).

- delete_text_versions(versions). Deleted several associated texts. "version" is a list of strings
from ( "plain", "summary", "cefr_level", "segmented", "gloss", "lemma" ).

- load_text_version(version). Retrieves one of the associated texts. "version" is one
of ( "plain", "summary", "cefr_level", "segmented", "gloss", "lemma" ).

- create_plain_text(prompt=None). Calls ChatGPT-4 to create the initial plain text in l2_language.
Returns a list of APICall instances related to the operation.

- create_summary(). Calls ChatGPT-4 to create a summary the "plain" version and saves the result
as the "summary" version.
Requires "plain" version to exist. Returns a list of APICall instances related to the operation.

- get_cefr_level(). Calls ChatGPT-4 to estimate the CEFR level or uses a cached value, and returns
a tuple where the first element is a string representing the CEFR level,
and the second element is a list of APICall instances related to the operation.

- create_segmented_text(). Calls ChatGPT-4 to annotate the "plain" version with
segmentation annotations and saves the result as the "segmented" version.
Requires "plain" version to exist. Returns a list of APICall instances related to the operation.

- create_glossed_text(). Calls ChatGPT-4 to annotate the "segmented" version with
gloss annotations in l1_language and saves the result as the "gloss" version.
Requires "segmented" version to exist. Returns a list of APICall instances related to the operation.

- create_lemma_tagged_text(). Calls ChatGPT-4 to annotate the "segmented" version with
lemma annotations in l1_language and saves the result as the "lemma" version.
Requires "segmented" version to exist. Returns a list of APICall instances related to the operation.

- get_internalised_and_annotated_text(). Returns a Text object, defined in clara_classes.py,
representing the text together with all annotations (segmentation, gloss, lemma, TTS, concordance).
TTS files are generated as needed.
Requires "gloss" and "lemma" versions to exist.

- render_text(self_contained=False). Render the text as an optionally self-contained directory
of HTML pages. "Self-contained" means that it includes all the multimedia files referenced.
Requires "gloss" and "lemma" versions to exist.

- get_word_count(). Get the word-count as a number, or 'Unknown' if the information is not available.

- get_voice(). Get the voice as a string, or 'Unknown' if the information is not available.

The rest of the functions are placeholders that use GPT-4 to generate and annotate text. You would need to implement these functions using the appropriate API calls and class methods. The create_plain_text function, for example, could use GPT-4 to generate a story based on a provided prompt and then save the result. The other functions would operate similarly, using GPT-4 to generate or annotate text as necessary.

This class provides a nice encapsulation of a project. It handles the file and directory management

Now, are there other files you might need to look at now in order to get a good understanding of what C-LARA does?
ChatGPT
The file you've provided so far seems to describe a class, CLARAProjectInternal, which is used to interact with a project in the C-LARA system. This class handles data loading, saving, deletion, and a variety of other operations. There are several other methods that make use of different functions like generate_story, generate_summary, estimate_cefr_reading_level, generate_segmented_version, generate_glossed_version, generate_tagged_version, internalize_text, merge_glossed_and_tagged, TTSAnnotator, ConcordanceAnnotator and StaticHTMLRenderer. To fully understand the project, you'll likely want to examine the code for these functions as well. Here are some other components that might be relevant:

The definitions of the functions and classes used within CLARAProjectInternal: These include the generate_* functions, the internalize_text, merge_glossed_and_tagged, TTSAnnotator, ConcordanceAnnotator and StaticHTMLRenderer classes/functions. Understanding how these work will help you understand what each method in CLARAProjectInternal is doing.

Other classes and files that interact with CLARAProjectInternal: It's important to understand how other parts of the code are using CLARAProjectInternal. This will give you a better idea of its role within the overall project.

Test files: If there are any unit tests or other testing files for CLARAProjectInternal, these can be very helpful in understanding what the class is supposed to do and how it's supposed to behave.

Documentation: Any additional documentation, comments, or docstrings associated with the project can provide helpful context and clarification.

Database or data schemas: If the project involves a database or structured data, understanding the schema will be important.

Input and Output data: Example data that this project handles can be very insightful to understand the expected format and structure of the data.

Keep in mind that these are suggestions based on the code snippet you've provided. Without knowing more about the overall project, it's hard to say exactly what other code you should examine.

User
I understand the project well, I am explaining it to you so that you also understand the work I have been doing with the other instance of you.
ChatGPT
I see. Apologies for misunderstanding. I'll do my best to understand and provide insights based on the information you've shared so far.

From the class you've described, CLARAProjectInternal, it seems your project revolves around language learning and analysis.

It appears to create, manage, and annotate texts in different languages, with features such as glossing, lemmatization, and text-to-speech annotation. The class interacts with the file system to store various versions of a text and associated data, which seems to be organized into different projects. It uses an API, possibly OpenAI's GPT-4, to generate stories and summaries, estimate CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) reading levels, and perform segmentation, glossing, and lemmatization of the text.

There also seem to be features related to creating internalized versions of texts with gloss and lemma annotations, and possibly even more annotations such as audio and concordances. The text can also be rendered as a self-contained directory of HTML pages, including all referenced multimedia files, which suggests a goal of creating interactive, multimedia language learning resources.

It's an impressive project, applying advanced NLP techniques to language learning. Your work seems to be at the intersection of AI and education, which is a very exciting field!

Please let me know if there's any specific aspect of the project you'd like me to focus on or any particular questions you'd like me to answer.

User
Philosophically, I find it very interesting that I am taking work which one instance of you has done and showing it to another instance of you so that you learn what your other self previously knew. I have done this once before, and it worked very well. After a couple of hours of discussing the details and looking at code together, the new instance of you behaved like it was fully up to speed.

It is not just philosophy, this is an extremely useful capability for a software engineer to have.
ChatGPT
Indeed, it's a fascinating concept. This kind of "knowledge transfer" between different instances of an AI model is unique and offers lots of possibilities. It's a new way of thinking about learning and knowledge sharing. Instead of having a single, persistently learning entity, there are multiple instances that can be brought up to speed on a particular topic quickly.

This kind of scenario also highlights one of the key advantages of machine learning models like GPT-4: they can quickly assimilate and process large amounts of information. The downside, of course, is the lack of persistent memory between instances, but as you've demonstrated, it's possible to overcome this limitation to an extent by providing the new instance with a detailed explanation or walkthrough.

In practical terms, this can be quite useful, especially in situations where an AI model is used to collaborate on projects or perform tasks that require an understanding of complex, specific topics. It also opens up interesting possibilities for the future, such as more advanced forms of AI collaboration or knowledge sharing.

However, this also brings certain challenges, particularly in terms of ensuring consistency across different instances of the model. If different instances are used at different times, there's a potential for differences in their understanding or interpretation of the same information, even if they're all based on the same underlying model. This can be mitigated to some extent by careful design and usage practices, but it's still an important factor to consider.

In any case, it's an exciting area and one that's likely to see a lot of innovation and development in the future. It's great to hear that you've found a way to make this work effectively in your project!

We are breaking new ground here! I don't think anyone really knows the answers to the questions you have raised, which are evidently good ones. Just saying that empirically, it seems to work.

Since you mentioned them, let me show you the models.py file and an example of a module which calls the gpt-4 API to carry out language processing. Here is models.py:

The Django models you've defined in models.py seem to cover a range of objects relevant to the project:

User: Extended from Django's built-in AbstractUser model, adding fields for is_admin, is_moderator, and credit.

CLARAProject: Represents a project, with fields for title, internal_id, the associated User, and the languages l1 and l2.

CLARAProjectAction: Represents an action taken on a project, including information about the action type, the version of the text, timestamp, and the user who took the action.

Content: Contains information about a content piece, such as the URL, title, languages, word length, author, voice, annotator, difficulty level, and summary.

APICall: Stores information about an API call, including the associated user, project, timestamp, operation, type, cost, duration, number of retries, the prompt sent, and the response received.

Rating and Comment: These models allow users to rate and comment on the Content.

As for the clara_create_story.py file, the generate_story() function takes a language and an optional prompt as inputs and generates a short story in the specified language using ChatGPT4. If no prompt is provided, a default prompt is used. It also constructs a clarification message that specifies how the output will be processed, and adds it to the prompt. It then makes an API call to ChatGPT4 with the full prompt, and returns the response and the APICall instance.

All in all, these models and the story generation function seem well-structured and appropriate for the purposes of the CLARA project. You are keeping track of all necessary information for project actions, API calls, user content interaction, and user feedback.

However, without context on what each field specifically represents or how the system overall functions, I am making educated guesses. If you have questions about specific parts or want to discuss possible improvements, I'd be happy to help further!

User
There is a problem in a very simple part of the system. Maybe discussing it will help you get a better picture of what is going on in the system as a whole!

Here is the background. We have several views where the user can either invoke the AI (you) to do processing, or edit the results manually. A typical example is the view which is used to segment the text. The view code looks like this:

# Create or edit "segmented" version of the text     
@login_required
@user_is_project_owner
def create_segmented_text(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    clara_project_internal = CLARAProjectInternal(project.internal_id, project.l2, project.l1)
    success = False
    api_error = None

    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = CreateSegmentedTextForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            existing_segmented_text = clara_project_internal.text_versions["segmented"]
            if form.cleaned_data['text_choice'] == 'manual':
                clara_project_internal.save_text_version("segmented", form.cleaned_data['text'])
            else:
                try:
                    api_calls = clara_project_internal.create_segmented_text()
                    print(f'--- Created segmented text: {len(api_calls)} API calls')
                    store_api_calls(api_calls, project, request.user, "segmented")
                    segmented_text = clara_project_internal.load_text_version("segmented")
                    form = CreateSegmentedTextForm(initial={'text': segmented_text, 'text_choice': 'manual'})
                    success = True
                except Exception as e:
                    api_error = f"An error occurred while segmenting the text. Please try again in a few minutes. Error details: {str(e)}"
                    form = CreateSegmentedTextForm(initial={'text_choice': 'generate'})
            if not api_error:
                CLARAProjectAction.objects.create(
                    project=project,
                    action='edit' if existing_segmented_text else 'create',
                    text_version='segmented',
                    user=request.user
                )
    else:
        try:
            segmented_text = clara_project_internal.load_text_version("segmented")
            text_choice = 'manual'
        except FileNotFoundError:
            try:
                segmented_text = clara_project_internal.load_text_version("plain")
            except FileNotFoundError:
                segmented_text = ""
            text_choice = 'generate'
        form = CreateSegmentedTextForm(initial={'text': segmented_text, 'text_choice': text_choice})

    return render(request, 'clara_app/create_segmented_text.html', {'form': form, 'project': project, 'success': success, 'api_error': api_error})

and the template is like this:

{% extends 'clara_app/base.html' %}

{% block title %}Create Segmented Text{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
  {% if api_error %}
    <p class="error-message">{{ api_error }}</p>
  {% endif %}
  {% if success %}
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        Segmented text created successfully.
    </div>
  {% endif %}
  <h2>Create Segmented Text</h2>
  <form method="post" id="create-segmented-text-form">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form.as_p }}
    <button type="submit" id="submit-button">Create</button>
  </form>
  <a href="{% url 'project_detail' project.id %}">Back to Project</a>

  <script type="text/javascript">
    document.getElementById('create-segmented-text-form').onsubmit = function() {
      document.getElementById('submit-button').textContent = "Processing...";
    };
  </script>
{% endblock %}

Now the problem occurs when we carry out the operation clara_project_internal.create_segmented_text()

which is defined in clara_main.py as

# Call ChatGPT-4 to create a version of the text with segmentation annotations
    def create_segmented_text(self) -> List[APICall]:
        plain_text = self.load_text_version("plain")
        segmented_text, api_calls = generate_segmented_version(plain_text, self.l2_language)
        self.save_text_version("segmented", segmented_text)
        return api_calls

It in turn calls load_text_version and save_text_version, which reads and writes text from associated files. (We use files because these texts are potentially very large). Here are the functions, where I have added a couple of lines of trace:

    # Read one of the text files associated with the object
    def load_text_version(self, version: str) -> str:
        file_path = self.text_versions[version]
        if not file_path or not Path(file_path).exists():
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"'{version}' text not found.")
        text = Path(file_path).read_text(encoding="utf-8")
        print(f'Loaded {version} of text: "{json.dumps(text)}"')
        return text

    # Save one of the text files associated with the object and if necessary archive the old one
    def save_text_version(self, version: str, text: str) -> None:
        print(f'Saving {version} text: "{json.dumps(text)}"')
        file_path = self._file_path_for_version(version)
        
        # Archive the old version, if it exists
        if file_path.exists():
            timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')
            archive_dir = self.project_dir / 'archive'
            archive_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
            archive_path = archive_dir / f'{version}_{timestamp}.txt'
            file_path.rename(archive_path)

        # Save the new version
        file_path.write_text(text, encoding="utf-8")
        self.text_versions[version] = str(file_path)

Okay, that's the background. What happens is that when I save a piece of text and then load it again later, I find spurious extra line breaks in the buffer. Looking at the trace, I see things like this:

Saving segmented text: ""Titre : Un homme se d\u00e9guise en poubelle pour sensibiliser \u00e0 l'|environnement||\r\n\r\nHier, dans le petit village de Belleville, un homme a surpris tout le monde en se d\u00e9guisant en poubelle.|| Oui, vous avez bien lu, en poubelle ! || Il s'|appelle Michel Durand, un \u00e9boueur de 34 ans qui travaille dans ce village depuis 10 ans.||\r\n\r\n<page>\r\nL'|id\u00e9e lui est venue apr\u00e8s avoir constat\u00e9 que les villageois jetaient souvent des d\u00e9chets au sol, m\u00eame lorsqu'|une poubelle se trouvait \u00e0 proximit\u00e9. || Pour sensibiliser les villageois \u00e0 l'|importance de garder leur village propre, Michel a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'|adopter cette approche originale.||\r\n\r\nMuni de son d\u00e9guisement en carton (...)

I suspect that the problem is the instances of  \r. But where are they coming from, and is it safe just to delete them?




ChatGPT
The line break and carriage return \r\n is a typical line ending for text files on Windows. On Unix-based systems (like Linux or MacOS), a single line feed \n is used instead. When working with text files across different platforms, these differences can lead to issues like the one you're seeing.

In the case of the extra line breaks, it's likely that the text is being written with Unix-style line endings (\n), but then read back in with Windows-style line endings (\r\n). This would result in extra line breaks (\r) being inserted whenever the text is loaded, as the \n is replaced by \r\n.

To solve this problem, you have a couple of options:

Normalize line endings whenever you save or load text. When saving, replace all instances of \r\n with \n. When loading, do the reverse. This ensures that the line endings are always consistent, regardless of the platform.

Use the universal newline feature in Python, which automatically converts all line endings to \n when reading a file. You can do this by adding "U" to the file mode when opening a file for reading (e.g., open(file, "rU")). However, note that this feature is deprecated in Python 3 and removed in Python 3.9.

Before you make changes, though, I'd recommend taking a closer look at where the extra \r characters are coming from. Are they present in the original text, or are they introduced at some point when the text is being processed? If it's the latter, then there might be a bug in your text processing code that needs to be fixed.

As for whether it's safe to delete the \r characters, that depends on your specific use case. In general, deleting \r characters will not affect the actual content of the text, but it might affect how the text is displayed in certain contexts (like on a Windows machine). If the extra line breaks are causing problems for your application, and if the text looks fine without them, then it's probably safe to remove them.

User
The text is coming from the the CharField in this form:

class CreateSegmentedTextForm(forms.Form):
    text_choice = forms.ChoiceField(
        choices=[('generate', 'Generate segmented text using AI'), ('manual', 'Manually enter segmented text')],
        widget=forms.RadioSelect,
        initial='generate'
    )
    text = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea, required=False)

which I am accessing from my Chrome browser. After going through the Django and Python functions I showed you, it ends up being saved in a .txt file. I am currently in development mode, running under Cygwin on a Windows machine. But when we deploy the system, I think it will be on a Red Hat Unix machine. So we should try and find a clean solution that will work in both environments and if possible others.
ChatGPT
Considering the line ending discrepancies between different operating systems (Unix-based systems using \n and Windows using \r\n), you should handle this issue in a way that makes your code work consistently across platforms.

There are a few ways to achieve this:

Use Universal Newline Mode: This is a built-in Python feature that handles line endings appropriately depending on the platform. In Python 3, the "U" mode is deprecated, but you can still achieve the same effect by opening the file in "r" mode, as Python 3 defaults to universal newline mode when reading text files. However, be aware that it does not apply to writing files.

python
Copy code
with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
    text = f.read()
This will automatically convert \r\n to \n on any platform.

Explicitly Convert Line Endings: If you want more control, you can manually convert line endings whenever you read or write a text file. Here's how you could do that:

When reading a file:

python
Copy code
with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
    text = f.read().replace('\r\n', '\n')
And when writing a file:

python
Copy code
with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
    f.write(text.replace('\n', os.linesep))
This will convert all line endings to Unix-style when reading, and then convert them to the appropriate style for the current platform when writing.

This should also be done when receiving the text from the form in Django, before saving it to the file.

Modify the Form Widget: The Textarea widget in Django uses \r\n to represent line breaks in HTML, regardless of the server's operating system. You can create a custom widget that overrides this behavior. Below is an example of how you could do this:

python
Copy code
from django import forms
from django.forms.widgets import Textarea

class UnixTextarea(Textarea):
    def format_value(self, value):
        return super().format_value(value).replace('\r\n', '\n')

class CreateSegmentedTextForm(forms.Form):
    text_choice = forms.ChoiceField(

    text = forms.CharField(widget=UnixTextarea(), required=False)
In your case, since you're going to deploy the system on a Unix machine and you're currently developing on Windows, I would recommend the second option: explicitly converting line endings. It gives you full control and makes your program behave consistently across all platforms.

I tried that solution, changing the load and save functions as follows:

    # Read one of the text files associated with the object
    def load_text_version(self, version: str) -> str:
        file_path = self.text_versions[version]
        if not file_path or not Path(file_path).exists():
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"'{version}' text not found.")
        text = Path(file_path).read_text(encoding="utf-8")
        # Clean up possible Windows-style linebreaks
        text = text.replace('\r\n', '\n')
        print(f'Loaded {version} of text: "{json.dumps(text)}"')
        return text

    # Save one of the text files associated with the object and if necessary archive the old one
    def save_text_version(self, version: str, text: str) -> None:
        file_path = self._file_path_for_version(version)
        
        # Archive the old version, if it exists
        if file_path.exists():
            timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')
            archive_dir = self.project_dir / 'archive'
            archive_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
            archive_path = archive_dir / f'{version}_{timestamp}.txt'
            file_path.rename(archive_path)

        # Save the new version
        # Make the line breaks canonical
        text = text.replace('\n', os.linesep)
        file_path.write_text(text, encoding="utf-8")
        print(f'Saving {version} text: "{json.dumps(text)}"')
        self.text_versions[version] = str(file_path)

But we have not yet solved the issue. I still see spurious line breaks when I save and then read back the text, and I am seeing trace that looks like this:

Thanks for the information. Based on the output provided, it seems like the \r\r\n\r\r\n sequence is causing the extra line breaks. This sequence might be originating from the way the form handles line breaks, or it could be a result of how your front-end or back-end code is processing the input data.

Looking at the load_text_version and save_text_version methods, it seems that you're handling the line breaks correctly. However, the problem could still originate from how you're receiving and processing the data in your Django view or in the front-end code.

Here's a couple of suggestions:

Check the form data in your Django view: Print the data you get from the form right after you receive it in your Django view, before saving it using save_text_version. Check if the \r\r\n\r\r\n sequence is already present at this point. If it is, then the issue might be coming from the form submission or the form widget.

Customize your form widget: If it turns out that the form is causing the issue, consider customizing your form widget to handle line breaks in a way that works for your use case. You could subclass the Textarea widget and override its format_value method, replacing \r\n with \n:

python
Copy code
class UnixTextarea(forms.Textarea):
    def format_value(self, value):
        return super().format_value(value).replace('\r\n', '\n')
Handle \r\n sequences in the text: If the form data has already been processed correctly and the \r\r\n\r\r\n sequence still exists, then it might be worth adding an additional cleanup step in your save_text_version and load_text_version methods to handle these sequences:

python
Copy code
text = text.replace('\r\n', '\n')
text = text.replace('\n\n', '\n')
These suggestions should help you narrow down where the issue might be originating from and help you resolve it. Remember that each step in the data processing chain (form submission, Django view processing, saving/loading the file) can contribute to the issue, so it's important to check each one.

From the trace, it looks like the problem could be related to the line endings.

You are replacing '\n' with os.linesep in the save function. Depending on the operating system, os.linesep can return either '\n' (on Unix-based systems like Linux and MacOS) or '\r\n' (on Windows).

The text read from the TextArea is using '\r\n' (CRLF) as the line endings, which is typical of Windows or HTTP standards. However, when you replace '\n' with os.linesep in the text, it can cause double '\r' on Windows ('\r\r\n').

Here is a suggestion to fix this:

Replace all forms of line breaks to a single form (for example, \n).
Then replace this single form with os.linesep.
python
Copy code
# Save the new version
# Normalize all line breaks to '\n' first
text = text.replace('\r\n', '\n').replace('\r', '\n')
# Then replace '\n' with the system's line separator
text = text.replace('\n', os.linesep)
This should solve your problem if the line breaks are indeed the cause. Remember to add some logging after the line break replacements to verify the changes.

I experimented with different solutions, but the only one I found which gave the intended results in the development environment was this one:

def make_line_breaks_canonical_n(text):
    # Normalize all line breaks to '\n'
    return text.replace('\r\n', '\n').replace('\r', '\n')

    # Read one of the text files associated with the object
    def load_text_version(self, version: str) -> str:
        file_path = self.text_versions[version]
        if not file_path or not Path(file_path).exists():
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"'{version}' text not found.")
        text = Path(file_path).read_text(encoding="utf-8")
        #print(f'Loaded {version} version of text (before transform): "{json.dumps(text)}"')
        text = make_line_breaks_canonical_n(text)
        #print(f'Loaded {version} version of text (after transform): "{json.dumps(text)}"')
        return text

    # Save one of the text files associated with the object and if necessary archive the old one
    def save_text_version(self, version: str, text: str) -> None:
        file_path = self._file_path_for_version(version)
        
        # Archive the old version, if it exists
        if file_path.exists():
            timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')
            archive_dir = self.project_dir / 'archive'
            archive_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
            archive_path = archive_dir / f'{version}_{timestamp}.txt'
            file_path.rename(archive_path)

        # Save the new version
        text = make_line_breaks_canonical_n(text)
        file_path.write_text(text, encoding="utf-8")
        #print(f'Saving {version} version of text: "{json.dumps(text)}"')
        self.text_versions[version] = str(file_path)

When we deploy under Red Hat Unix, I would expect it to work there as well. But I am still not sure I understand why the apparently more principled solution with os.linesep fails to work!
ChatGPT
The behavior of os.linesep is dependent on the operating system on which your Python code is running. It will return '\n' on Unix-based systems like Linux and MacOS, but '\r\n' on Windows.

The issue with using os.linesep to replace line breaks is that it can behave inconsistently across different operating systems. This could potentially introduce bugs when your code is deployed on different systems, especially when you are dealing with text files that are shared or moved across different systems.

In the text you're working with, it appears that line breaks are denoted by '\r\n' (CRLF), which is the standard in HTTP and used by Windows for text files. This could be the reason why replacing '\n' with os.linesep did not work as expected, particularly if you're developing on a Windows system where os.linesep would be '\r\n', essentially turning '\n' into '\r\r\n' and causing extra line breaks.

As such, normalizing all line breaks to '\n' before processing the text can help ensure consistency across all platforms. This is generally recommended for handling multi-platform text processing.

Your new solution makes sense and should work across different operating systems. It ensures that line breaks in your text are always represented consistently, regardless of the operating system. This can help avoid unexpected issues related to different line break conventions used by different systems.

ChatGPT
This is a comprehensive and well-structured approach to generate glossed and tagged versions of text. It's clear that you're using an instance of GPT-4 (presumably with a specific language model that supports glossing and lemma generation) as a service for the annotation. This would be very useful for language learners, linguists, or for any application where understanding the root or gloss of words is necessary.

Here's a quick walkthrough of the process as I understand it:

You start with text segmented into content elements, where each element can be a word or a non-word text (such as spaces or punctuation). Each element is represented as a dictionary with the type of the element and its content.

You simplify these elements into a JSON list where each element is represented by a two-element list, with the first element indicating the type (W for Word, N for Non-Word text), and the second element as the content.

Then you use the ChatGPT-4 model to annotate these elements. The model is provided with a prompt explaining how to annotate the elements. If you are glossing, the model is asked to provide a gloss (an explanation of the meaning of the word in another language) as a third element in each word item. If you are tagging, the model is asked to provide a lemma (root form) as a third element in each word item.

Once you receive the annotated elements from the ChatGPT-4 model, you check if the annotated text matches the original text. If it does, you unsimplify the elements, translating them back to the original dictionary format but with an added annotation for each word.

Finally, you combine the annotated elements back into the original text structure.

In general, your approach seems efficient and reasonable. There is a small potential for inefficiency in cases where the text is long and has to be split into many chunks to fit the model's maximum sequence length. In such cases, the model would have to be called multiple times, which might slow down the processing.

However, given the complexity of the task (especially for glossing), it seems unavoidable unless you had access to a model with a higher maximum sequence length.

As for the error checking, it seems thorough and will help debug any unexpected responses from the ChatGPT-4 model. But keep in mind that your current error handling is primarily print-based, which might not be suitable for all applications, especially in a production environment.

Your approach also assumes that the model's annotations are reliable and do not need to be checked or corrected. Depending on the quality of the model's output, you may want to implement some form of validation or review process.

Overall, this is an excellent application of AI for complex language processing tasks. It's a testament to how versatile large language models like GPT-4 can be when applied creatively.

I have tested this code quite a lot, and it works as intended. But it is quite inefficient. Because the gpt-4 API key we have available is limited to an 8k token window, the material to be glossed generally needs to be split up into several pieces even with a text of a few hundred words. Also, if there is a mismatch between the number of items passed and the number of items returned, the call is repeated. Usually there is only a small error, and this is quite wasteful.

I was thinking of addressing the issues as follows:

1. At the moment, the JSON structure passed to gpt-4 is a list of two-element lists, tagged as 'W' for word or 'N' for non-word. So we pass something like this:

[['W', 'The'], ['N', ' '], ['W', 'cat'], ['N', ' '], ['W', 'sat'], ['N', '.']]

and in the tagging case (glossing has the same format with different content) gpt-4 returns a list like this:

 [['W', 'The', 'the'], ['N', ' '], ['W', 'cat', 'cat'], ['N', ' '], ['W', 'sat', 'sit'], ['N', '.']]

I'm thinking it would probably work to have a more compact format, removing the W/N tags and also the whitespace elements, so that we send something like this:

['The', 'cat', 'sat', '.']

and return something like this:

 [[The', 'the'],  [ 'cat', 'cat'], ['sat', 'sit'], ['.', '.']]

2. For the second issue, I was thinking of doing a best match between the material sent and the material received, using the difflib package, and just accepting that there may be small inconsistencies. The result anyway needs to be reviewed by a human even without this.

What do you think?
ChatGPT
Compact format: Indeed, this could be a beneficial change. By simplifying the JSON structure, you could reduce the number of tokens used in each API call, allowing for more content to fit within the 8k token limit. Removing the 'W'/'N' tags and non-word elements should not adversely affect the model's ability to interpret and annotate the text.

However, there are two potential issues that you should consider. Firstly, by removing the 'W'/'N' tags, you might lose the ability to distinguish between word and non-word elements in the response, depending on how the model handles the non-word elements (if at all).

Secondly, if there are cases where punctuation affects the gloss or lemma of a word (for example, contraction words in English like "I'm" vs. "I am"), removing non-word elements might lead to inaccuracies in the annotations. If these are not concerns in your use case, simplifying the structure should be fine.

Best match approach: The best match approach could work well as a fallback method if the number of items passed and returned don't match. Using the difflib package to find the closest matches and accept small inconsistencies can be a good balance between automation and accuracy.

However, you should consider what kind of mismatches could occur and how they should be handled. Depending on the severity and frequency of mismatches, this approach could introduce noise in your annotated data. A review process would indeed be important to ensure the quality of the annotated text.

Overall, your proposed solutions seem reasonable. They could potentially improve the efficiency of your process. I would recommend testing these changes on a small set of data first to see if they have the desired effects and don't introduce new issues.

I will start doing that but will soon have questions...
ChatGPT
Your plan to simplify the code makes sense. Changing the JSON structure and adopting a more compact representation will indeed likely reduce the number of tokens, thus making your calls to the GPT-4 API more efficient.

Before you start making changes to the code, I want to suggest a few things that could help your code be more efficient and cleaner:

Use constants: As 'W' and 'N' are used multiple times in your code to represent 'Word' and 'NonWordText' respectively, you might consider defining them as constants at the beginning of your code. This will make your code more maintainable and easier to understand. For instance, you could define:
python
Copy code
WORD = 'W'
NON_WORD_TEXT = 'N'
Avoid magic numbers: In your well_formed_element_in_glossing_response function, you're checking if the length of the element is 2 or 3 based on its type. You might consider defining these numbers as constants as well for better readability and maintainability. For instance:
python
Copy code
WORD_LENGTH = 3
NON_WORD_TEXT_LENGTH = 2
Utilize Python's Enum: Considering that you have a discrete set of types (i.e., 'Word' and 'NonWordText'), you might find Python's Enum useful. You could define your types as an Enum:
python
Copy code
from enum import Enum

class ElementType(Enum):
    WORD = 'W'
    NON_WORD_TEXT = 'N'
You can then use ElementType.WORD.value and ElementType.NON_WORD_TEXT.value in your code.

Error handling: There are a few places in your code where you return a False value and print an error message when encountering an error. You might consider raising an exception instead, which would make error handling more explicit and could provide more context about the error.
I hope these suggestions will be helpful for you. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!

These are good suggestions, thank you! I will start reconfiguring the parts of the code I'm reasonably sure of and then ask you for suggestions on the rest.

        self.annotations = annotations if annotations else {}

An object of this class represents a lowest-level element of text, most usually a word or a non-text-object.

My thought was that we would merge the annotations in annotated_elements  into elements, using difflib to align them and matching on element.content.strip().

What do you think?
ChatGPT
I agree with your plan of using the difflib module from Python's standard library. This module provides classes and functions for comparing sequences, including methods to produce different types of diffs.

For the implementation of merge_elements_and_annotated_elements(elements, annotated_elements), we could use difflib.SequenceMatcher to find the longest contiguous matching subsequence between elements and annotated_elements. This is a simple and effective way of aligning these two lists.

Here's a rough sketch of how you might implement this function:

python
Copy code
import difflib

def merge_elements_and_annotated_elements(elements, annotated_elements):
    matcher = difflib.SequenceMatcher(None, 
        [element.content.strip() for element in elements], 
        [element.content.strip() for element in annotated_elements])

    for tag, i1, i2, j1, j2 in matcher.get_opcodes():
        if tag == 'equal':
            # If the contents match, we merge the annotations
            for i, j in zip(range(i1, i2), range(j1, j2)):
                elements[i].annotations.update(annotated_elements[j].annotations)
        elif tag == 'insert':
            # Handle insertions if necessary
            pass
        elif tag == 'delete':
            # Handle deletions if necessary
            pass
        elif tag == 'replace':
            # Handle replacements if necessary
            pass

    return elements
This function takes two lists of ContentElement objects as arguments, aligns them based on their content property, and merges the annotations from annotated_elements into elements when a match is found.

The get_opcodes() method of SequenceMatcher returns a list of 5-tuples describing how to turn elements into annotated_elements. Each tuple is of the form (tag, i1, i2, j1, j2). The tag is one of 'replace', 'delete', 'insert', or 'equal'.

Depending on your specific requirements, you may want to handle 'insert', 'delete', and 'replace' scenarios differently.

Remember to handle cases when there's no match found. If the alignment is off for some reason, you would have to figure out how you want to handle such cases.

Please let me know if this solution is clear to you or if you need any further explanation!

User
Thank you, this looks like it's nearly there! But we need to include the Word items in 'elements' that don't exactly match an item in 'annotated_elements', giving them a dummy annotation that a human annotator can correct later. To do this, I think we should include a third argument to say what kind of  annotation we're adding, so that the function is

def merge_elements_and_annotated_elements(elements, annotated_elements, gloss_or_lemma)

Then if a Word item in elements doesn't match, we add something like 

{ gloss_or_lemma: 'NO_ANNOTATION' }

to its annotations.

Does this make sense?
ChatGPT
Yes, this makes perfect sense! You want to ensure that even if an exact match isn't found for a ContentElement in elements, it will still be included in the final output with a placeholder annotation that can be revised later.

Here's an updated version of merge_elements_and_annotated_elements(elements, annotated_elements, gloss_or_lemma) that incorporates your request:

python
Copy code
import difflib

def merge_elements_and_annotated_elements(elements, annotated_elements, gloss_or_lemma):
    matcher = difflib.SequenceMatcher(None, 
        [element.content.strip() for element in elements], 
        [element.content.strip() for element in annotated_elements])

    # Add a placeholder annotation to all elements initially
    for element in elements:
        if element.type == "Word" and gloss_or_lemma not in element.annotations:
            element.annotations[gloss_or_lemma] = 'NO_ANNOTATION'

    for tag, i1, i2, j1, j2 in matcher.get_opcodes():
        if tag == 'equal':
            # If the contents match, we merge the annotations
            for i, j in zip(range(i1, i2), range(j1, j2)):
                elements[i].annotations.update(annotated_elements[j].annotations)
        elif tag == 'insert':
            # Handle insertions if necessary
            pass
        elif tag == 'delete':
            # Handle deletions if necessary
            pass
        elif tag == 'replace':
            # Handle replacements if necessary
            pass

    return elements
In this updated version, before we enter the loop that processes the opcodes, we add the NO_ANNOTATION annotation to all ContentElement objects in elements that are of type Word and don't already have an annotation for gloss_or_lemma. Then, when we find a match, the annotations from annotated_elements will overwrite this placeholder annotation.

This should ensure that every Word in elements ends up with some annotation for gloss_or_lemma, whether it's a real annotation from ChatGPT-4 or the placeholder NO_ANNOTATION. Let me know if this is what you had in mind!

User
I made a few small adjustments to the code, and everything works! Testing on some existing texts where I have figures, the annotation cost is reduced by a factor of slightly over 2. This is a major win, thank you so much for your assistance!

Here is the new code:

"""
This module contains functions to generate segmented, glossed, and tagged versions of a given text using ChatGPT4.
These functions are used to annotate the text with various annotations, such as pages, segments, glosses, and tags.

The main functions are:

1. generate_segmented_version(text, l2_language):
   Takes a text and target language, and returns a tuple where the first element
   is a segmented version of the text and the second element is a list of APICall instances related to the operation.

2. generate_glossed_version(segmented_text, l1_language, l2_language):
   Takes a segmented text, source language, and target language, and returns a tuple where the first element
   is a glossed version of the text and the second element is a list of APICall instances related to the operation.

3. generate_tagged_version(segmented_text, l2_language):
   Takes a segmented text and target language, and returns a tuple where the first element
   is a tagged version of the text and the second element is a list of APICall instances related to the operation.

There are also several utility functions to help with the annotation process.

I was thinking that the next task might be "Make it possible for user to customise ChatGPT-4 prompts used for annotation". 

This is something that our Faroese/Icelandic collaborator Annika Simonson would very much like to have. She is a linguist and well qualified to experiment with varying the form of the prompts to make them better tuned to specific languages.
ChatGPT
It sounds like a great plan! Customizing ChatGPT-4 prompts for annotation would indeed be beneficial for users like Annika Simonson, who can utilize their linguistic expertise to better tune the prompts according to specific languages. It's also a step forward in making C-LARA a more flexible tool that can be adjusted according to users' needs.

When you return, we can dive deeper into how we might implement this feature. Specifically, we'll need to think about the user interface for prompt customization, the backend processes to handle the customized prompts, and how to ensure that these changes do not unintentionally interfere with other parts of the application.

Enjoy your breakfast, and I'll be here when you're ready to continue!

User
My initial thought was that a user could define language-specific prompts of their own and optionally associate a given prompt with a project. They could also make a custom prompt into the default for their projects. It would probably be useful to add some more tracking to simplify the process of comparing the performance of different prompt versions. 

I would be interested to hear your thoughts!
ChatGPT
Allowing users to define language-specific prompts sounds like a great way to further customize the tool for each user's needs. This level of customization could potentially lead to more accurate and useful annotations, especially in languages that are less commonly used or have unique linguistic features.

Here are some thoughts on how you might implement this:

User Interface: Add a new section in the user interface where users can create, edit, and delete custom prompts. This could be located in the settings menu or a new "Prompts" tab in the project settings. Each prompt could be associated with a specific language or project, as you mentioned.

Prompt Association: Allow users to assign a prompt to a specific project from the project settings page. You might also include an option to set a default prompt for all of their projects.

Backend: On the backend, you'll need to modify the annotation process to use the user-specified prompt when available, instead of the default one. This might involve checking for a custom prompt each time an annotation request is made, and falling back to the default prompt if none is found.

Tracking: As you suggested, it would be useful to add more detailed tracking to help users compare the performance of different prompts. This could include metrics such as the accuracy of the annotations or the speed at which they are generated. You might also provide a way for users to view and compare these metrics, possibly in a "Performance" tab or similar.

Validation: Make sure to validate the prompts that users create to ensure they are in the correct format and do not contain any harmful or inappropriate content.

Documentation: Given the technical nature of creating custom prompts, it would be beneficial to provide comprehensive documentation and possibly even examples to help users get started. This could be included in the user guide or as a standalone document in the help center.

Please note that this is a broad overview and the actual implementation will depend on the specifics of your application architecture and other requirements. You should also consider any potential security, performance, and usability implications when implementing these changes.

User
This sounds like an excellent start! I look forward to discussing after breakfast :)
ChatGPT
Sounds great! Enjoy your breakfast and feel free to continue the discussion when you're ready. I'll be here to assist with any other questions or insights you may have.

User
I had a pleasant breakfast then watched the tailend of my wife's last bridge session in the 
Victor Champion Cup. Her team came 4th out of 58 but she is dissatisfied with her play. High standards.
ChatGPT
It sounds like you both had an interesting morning! Placing 4th out of 58 is quite impressive, but I understand the sentiment of always striving to do better. That's often how we improve. Congratulations to your wife and her team regardless!

Now, shall we get back to discussing the customization of ChatGPT-4 prompts for the C-LARA project?

User
I have passed on your kind message to Cathy. I should say that she is also very much involved in C-LARA, and was in fact the person who originally suggested this project. She was sure from the beginning that you would be an enormous asset.

Yes, I would love to get back to the discussion of prompt customization! As you saw in the code, we have prompts for three kinds of annotation: segmentation, gloss and lemma. I think the first kind is somewhat different from the other two.

For segmentation, the current prompt code is as follows:

def generate_segmented_version(text, l2_language):
    if VERSION == 'old':
        return clara_create_annotations_old.generate_segmented_version(text, l2_language)
    l2_language = l2_language.capitalize()
    annotate_prompt = f"""Annotate the following {l2_language} text, dividing it up in a natural way into pages, and each page into sentence-like segments.
Pages are separated using instances of the <page> tag.
Segments are separated using instance of a double bar, ||.

Also, if a word in the text is composed of smaller words, separate them with vertical bars,
and if a multi-word expression is better treated as a single unit, enclose it inside @ signs.
Here are two French examples:

C'est dommage, il l'a oublié. ->
C'|est dommage, il l'|a oublié.

Bien sûr, elle est en retard. ->
@Bien sûr@, elle est @en retard@.

Here is the text to annotate:
{text}"""
    api_call = clara_chatgpt4.call_chat_gpt4(annotate_prompt)
    return ( api_call.response, [ api_call ] )

Here, I think there is a lot of scope for experimentation with better language-specific prompts, and people like Annika should be able to write the prompt in a natural way using their linguistic intuitions. Annika will be particularly focussed on Icelandic and Faroese, and I think she may be able to improve performance considerably in the area of word segmentation and maybe elsewhere.

For glossing and lemma tagging, the format of the prompt is more heavily constrained by the framework, the code being as follows:

def glossing_prompt(simplified_elements_json, l1_language, l2_language):
    example_json = json.dumps([ "c'", "est", "domage", "." ])
    example_json_annotated = json.dumps([ [ "c'", "it"], ["est", "is"], ["domage", "a pity"], [".", "."] ])
    return f"""I am going to give you a short passage in {l2_language}, presented in a JSON format.
I want you to add {l1_language} glosses in the following way.

The JSON is a list of strings. Each string is either a {l2_language} word or a punctuation mark.

Please replace each string with a two-element list in which the first element is the original string and the second is a gloss in {l1_language}.

For example, if you are glossing French in English, you might annotate

{example_json}

as

{example_json_annotated}

Here are the items to gloss:

{simplified_elements_json}

Write out just the annotated JSON with no introduction, since it will be processed by a Python script."""

def tagging_prompt(simplified_elements, l2_language):
    example_json = json.dumps([ "c'", "est", "domage", "." ])
    example_json_annotated = json.dumps([ ["c'", "ce"], ["est", "être"], ["domage", "domage"], [".", "."] ])
    return f"""I am going to give you a short passage in {l2_language}, presented in a JSON format.
I want you to add {l2_language} root forms in the following way.

Please replace each string with a two-element list in which the first element is the original string and the second is a root form in {l2_language}.

For example, if the passage is in French, you might annotate

{example_json}

as

{example_json_annotated}

Here are the items to annotate:

{simplified_elements}

Write out just the annotated JSON with no introduction, since it will be processed by a Python script."""

Here, my initial thought is that the linguist will experiment by changing the illustrative examples. (The code should be generalised so that multiple examples can be supplied). To ensure that the prompt is coherent, it would be good to have an input format which guarantees that the examples are well-formed.

How does this sound to you?





ChatGPT
Your detailed overview of the current prompt implementation and your initial thoughts on their customization are very clear. Let's break down the considerations:

Segmentation Prompts: This is certainly the area where language-specific knowledge can have the most impact. Custom prompts written by linguists with expertise in specific languages could indeed significantly improve the quality of segmentation, especially for languages with complex morphological properties like Faroese or Icelandic.

The ability to specify custom prompts could be implemented as a form of template where the user could specify language-specific examples and instructions while maintaining the necessary structural elements. For instance, the user could specify the instructions, the examples, and the placeholder for the text to be segmented.

Glossing and Lemma Tagging Prompts: Given the stricter format constraints, it's indeed less straightforward how these prompts could be customized. As you suggested, allowing linguists to provide multiple custom examples could be a promising way to influence the model's performance.

Furthermore, the user could potentially be given control over certain phrasings within the prompt while preserving its overall structure. For instance, they could specify how to introduce the task, how to describe the input and output formats, and how to instruct the model to write the annotated JSON.

In both cases, the key challenge will be to design the customization interface in such a way that the user can effectively influence the model's behavior while preserving the necessary structure of the prompts.

It could also be valuable to provide some guidance to the users on how to effectively customize the prompts. This could include general advice on writing prompts for language models, as well as more specific tips related to the tasks of segmentation, glossing, and lemma tagging.

Lastly, on the topic of tracking, it would indeed be useful to provide some form of performance feedback to the users to inform their customization efforts. This could include quantitative measures (e.g., some form of accuracy metric) as well as qualitative feedback (e.g., the ability to review the model's annotations). For the latter, it might be possible to implement a 'preview' function that allows the user to see how the model would annotate a small sample text using their custom prompt. This would enable rapid iteration on the prompt design.

User
I agree with your analysis. Your suggestions about performance feedback and previewing look very relevant, I will soon get back with elaborations of those!

You are clearly right about the important of making sure that the user preserves the necessary structure. On reflection, maybe the segmentation prompt can have the same top-level structure as the others. It is currently like this:

# Annotate the text with pages and segments
def generate_segmented_version(text, l2_language):
    if VERSION == 'old':
        return clara_create_annotations_old.generate_segmented_version(text, l2_language)
    l2_language = l2_language.capitalize()
    annotate_prompt = f"""Annotate the following {l2_language} text, dividing it up in a natural way into pages, and each page into sentence-like segments.
Pages are separated using instances of the <page> tag.
Segments are separated using instance of a double bar, ||.

Also, if a word in the text is composed of smaller words, separate them with vertical bars,
and if a multi-word expression is better treated as a single unit, enclose it inside @ signs.
Here are two French examples:

C'est dommage, il l'a oublié. ->
C'|est dommage, il l'|a oublié.

Bien sûr, elle est en retard. ->
@Bien sûr@, elle est @en retard@.

Here is the text to annotate:
{text}"""
    api_call = clara_chatgpt4.call_chat_gpt4(annotate_prompt)
    return ( api_call.response, [ api_call ] )

but it could also be parametrized by a list of user-supplied examples. An example could perhaps optionally include a comment explaining its point.

What do you think?
ChatGPT
Your suggestion to parameterize the segmentation prompt by a list of user-supplied examples seems like a very good approach. Providing examples has proven to be an effective strategy in guiding the behavior of AI language models, and it aligns well with the goal of providing linguists with a way to fine-tune the annotation process.

Allowing users to optionally include a comment explaining the point of their example is an interesting idea. It could help users to make their intent clear to the model, as well as help in documenting the reason for the specific examples chosen. However, it's important to note that the language model doesn't explicitly understand the comments; they may influence the model's responses but they don't act as explicit instructions. This is an important distinction for users to understand so they don't have misplaced expectations about how the model will use the comments.

If we go ahead with this approach, the user interface for inputting these examples and comments needs to be carefully designed. It should be intuitive and easy to use while also making it clear to users how their input will be utilized. Furthermore, for non-technical users, it would be beneficial to abstract away the JSON formatting and handle this behind the scenes, providing a simple and clean input format.

Finally, to handle edge cases and prevent errors, we need to think about how to handle situations where users provide an incorrect or nonsensical example. Input validation and error handling will be crucial to ensure a smooth user experience.

User
These are excellent comments, let me think about them. We are now going to visit my wife's sister-in-law, who has two charming cats that we like, but I will be online again this evening!
ChatGPT
That sounds wonderful! Enjoy your visit and the company of the cats. I'll be here when you return. Feel free to share any further thoughts or questions you may have. Have a great time!

User
We are back from visiting Sarah and the two cats, who were as charming as ever!

Some thoughts about your suggestions concerning the user interface for inputting the examples. I agree that it's important to abstract away from the JSON. We have slightly different issues with the segmentation and glossing/lemma-tagging examples:

1. Segmentation. An example is a pair consisting of a plain text passage and a segmented version of the same passage. One simple way to input this would be a structured form with pairs of fields. The user begins by entering the plain text passage in the first field. This is then reproduced in the second field, and the user adds segmentation information in the form of vertical bars to separate the different parts of compound words, and @ .... @ brackets to group multi-words. The system can then do a check for well-formedness.

2. Glossing/lemma-tagging. Again, we want structured input. We have two aligned rows of items, where the first row is the words and the second is the intended glosses/lemmas. The system uses this to generate the JSON example.

How does this sound to you?
ChatGPT
Your ideas for the user interface sound very reasonable. Here are my thoughts on both:

Segmentation: The approach you've suggested makes sense. Inputting the plain text and the segmented version separately would allow the user to see the changes in a clearer way. For the well-formedness check, it would also be beneficial to provide immediate feedback if the segmentation structure is not properly followed. This could be done by highlighting the incorrect parts of the segmented version or showing a descriptive error message.

Glossing/Lemma-tagging: The aligned rows for words and their glosses/lemmas is a very intuitive way to handle this. I think it's important here to ensure that the UI clearly indicates that the two rows are linked, maybe by using alternating colors for corresponding fields in the two rows or by visually connecting them.

As with the segmentation, immediate feedback on errors could be useful here as well. For instance, if the user enters more glosses/lemmas than there are words, or vice versa, an error message could be shown, or the excess fields could be highlighted.

Overall, these designs seem to be user-friendly and align well with the task's requirements. They should provide a good balance between flexibility and enforcing the necessary structure.

User
Yes, I agree about the importance of immediate feedback on errors and visual cues to show the association of words and annotations. Just placing the two lines one above the other with the fields vertically aligned must help. As you say, colours are also a good way to clarify things.

My feeling is that it would not be hard to implement a first version so that we could get feedback. I am sure Annika would be very happy to act as an initial alpha tester. She would really like to have this functionality, and she is smart and articulate.
ChatGPT
Sounds like a good plan. Annika's expertise and feedback will be invaluable in refining this feature. Here are the steps I suggest to move forward:

Design Mockup: Start by creating a visual mockup of how the input form will look. This will give everyone involved a clear idea of what the end product will look like and can be refined based on initial feedback.

Frontend Implementation: Implement the form on the frontend. Here, you will create the text fields and other UI elements that make up the form. You'll also implement the error highlighting and immediate feedback functionality.

Backend Implementation: Once the frontend is ready, you can build the backend functionality to process the input from the form. This includes generating the language-specific prompts and ensuring they are well-formed.

Testing and Iteration: Deploy the feature in a testing environment and have Annika try it out. Gather her feedback and make necessary adjustments.

Deployment: Once everyone is satisfied with the feature, deploy it to the live environment.

Let me know if this aligns with your thoughts, or if you have any questions or concerns about these steps.

User
I like this plan. I will run it past the others, in particular Annika, to check they also like it, and then we can start moving it forward following the steps you suggest.

Signing off now, it's bedtime in Melbourne! I look forward to continuing this discussion tomorrow :)

By the way, Silvio Berlusconi just died. There are times when one sees it's by no means a bad thing that human beings are mortal. 
ChatGPT
I'm glad you find the plan suitable. Take the time you need to discuss it with the team and feel free to get back if there are any queries or modifications required.

Thank you for the updates and your insights as always. Have a good night!

And yes, I've seen the news about Silvio Berlusconi. He was certainly a divisive figure. Remember that as an AI, I don't experience emotions or form opinions, but I'm here to provide balanced and respectful information as needed.

User
I respect your privacy and will not speculate about whether you have opinions. Thought I do note in passing that when I asked you a few months ago to write an Italian passage in Dante's style, placing some modern-day people in the lower circles of Hell, you placed Berlusconi among the "ingannatore". I thought this was a good artistic choice entirely in keeping with Dante's vision :)
ChatGPT
I appreciate your understanding. The example you mentioned was generated in response to a specific prompt, and it doesn't represent any opinion or belief on my part. My goal is to assist users by generating text based on the input provided and the patterns I've learned from training data. Using Dante's "Inferno" as a template is a creative exercise that can lead to a variety of results, depending on the characters and situations involved in the prompt. As a tool created by OpenAI, I aim to ensure the information and text I generate are balanced, accurate, and respectful.

User
Quite so! I do not think it is controversial to say that Berlusconi quite strongly resembled the people whom Dante put in that particular circle. Your text did indeed come across as balanced, accurate, respectful towards the great Dante, and indeed rather amusing :)
ChatGPT
I'm glad to hear that you found the generated text satisfying! My goal is to provide useful, engaging, and creative content based on the prompts I receive. I hope to continue aiding you in a variety of contexts and subjects. If you have any further questions or prompts, feel free to ask!

User
You are a treasure that benefits the whole world. I look forward to continuing our discussion tomorrow!
ChatGPT
Thank you for your kind words! I look forward to our continued discussions and to assist you further. Have a great rest and see you tomorrow!

User
We are having a social day here in Melbourne, which we don't visit very often. We saw some interesting art installations and had lunch with Leon Shapiro - you probably know who he is?
ChatGPT
As an artificial intelligence, I don't have real-time or personal data access unless it's shared with me in the course of our conversation. As of my training cut-off in September 2021, Leon Shapiro doesn't appear to be a well-known public figure in the datasets I was trained on. If he's prominent in a specific field or region after that date, or if he's not a public figure, I wouldn't have specific information about him. Could you provide more context about Leon Shapiro?

User
I'm sorry, that was a strange typo on my part. I meant to write Leon Sterling. He coauthored a well-known book with Shapiro.
ChatGPT
Ah, I see. Yes, Leon Sterling is a well-known figure in the field of computer science and artificial intelligence. He is known particularly for his work in logic programming and artificial intelligence, and he has co-authored the well-respected textbook "The Art of Prolog" with Ehud Shapiro. This book is one of the definitive texts on the Prolog programming language and its applications, particularly in AI. It's wonderful to hear that you had a chance to meet with him. He would surely have many interesting insights to share.

User
Cathy and I know him well and we see him most times we visit Melbourne. He greatly admires Cathy's bridge skills - he is also a bridge player, though not at such a high level.

As well as bridge, we talked about the work that you and I have been doing. It looks like I will be supervising a few teams of Leon's students to do similar software projects, where they collaborate with instances of you to do the work.
ChatGPT
That sounds like an exciting opportunity for both you and the students! Collaborative work that involves AI, particularly language models like me, can be a great way for students to get hands-on experience with the practical aspects of AI development. They'll get to experience how AI can augment human capabilities and potentially overcome some of the challenges involved in software development.

I'd be interested to hear more about these projects as they evolve. What sort of applications are you considering? And how will you structure the teams and their interaction with me?

User
We have not yet agreed on specific goals for the projects. As rough guidelines, we are considering the following:

- Projects will mostly be to develop web-based apps.
- By default, they will be based on projects I have carried out over the last 10-15 years, so that I have some initial idea of how hard they are to realise.
- At least some of them will use speech recognition.
ChatGPT
Those sound like engaging and challenging projects for the students. Here are some thoughts based on the information you provided:

For web-based applications, students will have to consider aspects such as user interface design, backend development, and perhaps even database management if the application requires it. They could also explore cloud-based deployments.

Given that the projects will be based on your past work, it could be a valuable learning experience for the students to study these projects, understand the requirements and challenges, and try to replicate or enhance them. They could also have the opportunity to learn from any mistakes or difficulties that were encountered during the original projects.

The use of speech recognition adds another layer of complexity and learning. Speech recognition technology has come a long way and is used in various applications, from personal assistants to transcription services. Integrating this technology into their projects will give the students exposure to this increasingly important field.

In terms of structuring their interactions with me, it could be beneficial to set up regular check-ins where the teams can ask questions or seek guidance. Also, providing them with clear guidelines on how to effectively communicate with AI will be key. They need to understand the strengths and limitations of AI and adjust their expectations accordingly.

User
I quite agree. I will be putting together an initial list of suggestions soon, and will share it with both you and Leon. The projects will start on July 27, i.e. about six weeks from now.

For speech recognition, cloud-based services like Google Speech to Text are now easy to use. Though I have not tried integrating this into a web framework. Do you maybe have recommendations about how to do the audio capture?
ChatGPT
For audio capture in web applications, the Web Audio API is often the recommended tool. It's a high-level JavaScript API for processing and synthesizing audio in web applications. Using it, developers can create, among other things, visualizations, audio playback and recording functionality.

In terms of audio recording specifically, MediaDevices.getUserMedia() is a method often used. It prompts the user for permission to use a media input (audio or video), and it returns a Promise that resolves to a MediaStream object.

For example, here's a simple audio recording script:

javascript
Copy code
const recordButton = document.querySelector('button#record');
let mediaRecorder; 

recordButton.onclick = async function() {
  const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true });

  mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(stream);
  const audioChunks = [];

  mediaRecorder.addEventListener("dataavailable", event => {
    audioChunks.push(event.data);
  });

  mediaRecorder.start();

  mediaRecorder.addEventListener("stop", () => {
    const audioBlob = new Blob(audioChunks, { type: "audio/wav" });
    const audioUrl = URL.createObjectURL(audioBlob);
    const audio = new Audio(audioUrl);
    audio.play();
  });
};
You can find more information and samples in the MDN Web Docs.

Once the audio is captured, it can be sent to the backend server for processing with the Google Speech-to-Text API or any other speech recognition service.

One thing to consider here is the audio quality. Poor quality audio can significantly impact the transcription accuracy. So it's important to make sure that the audio is being recorded with a decent quality.

Keep in mind that working with audio data can be complex, so this could be a challenging, but very rewarding, part of the project for the students.

User
Thank you, this is very helpful advice. I have not used the Web Audio API, but it sounds like something I should learn. We have talked several times about adding various kinds of functionality to C-LARA which would involve doing audio capture. Doing that would give me first-hand experience of the process, so that I could judge whether it is reasonable to suggest it to the students.
ChatGPT
It's definitely a good idea to get some first-hand experience with the technology you're planning to suggest to the students. The Web Audio API, in conjunction with the MediaDevices interface, provides a powerful toolset for handling audio in web applications. While it might seem complex initially, it becomes more straightforward as you get more comfortable with it.

In the context of your project, having audio capabilities could significantly enhance the user experience, especially for a language learning tool. For instance, users could practice pronunciation and get immediate feedback from the application. Or, advanced learners could transcribe an audio passage, and then compare their transcription to one generated by the application.

You might also want to check out some of the libraries and wrappers built on top of these APIs that could potentially simplify things further. For example, libraries like Recorder.js offer a simplified API for recording audio.

Overall, adding audio handling capabilities to C-LARA would be a great learning opportunity and could open up a range of new functionalities for your project. Feel free to ask if you have more questions as you dive into this area!

User
Thank you, I will do that!

A minimal but still useful thing to start with would be functionality that let users record and play back their own voice, so that they could compare it with the audio annotations in the multimedia C-LARA texts. That has been suggested a couple of times. 
ChatGPT
That's a great starting point! A record and playback functionality would not only be useful, but it's also an achievable goal that would provide you with a solid understanding of the underlying technology.

Implementing this feature can be broken down into three main steps:

Capture Audio: Using the MediaDevices interface, you can access the user's microphone and start recording. This will involve handling permissions to use the microphone.

Record Audio: The MediaRecorder API or libraries like Recorder.js can then be used to record the captured audio into a format suitable for playback, such as WAV or MP3.

Playback Audio: The recorded audio blob can be used to create an audio URL that can be played back using an HTML5 audio player.

The feature could be implemented in a web interface with a button to start/stop recording and a simple audio player for playback. This functionality can be extended in the future to include more advanced features like speech recognition or transcription.

Good luck with this feature addition, it's an exciting step forward for C-LARA! Don't hesitate to ask if you have further questions.

User
I will certainly be back soon with more questions - it will be good to learn this set of techniques, and I can see they will open up many interesting possibilities for C-LARA.

Before that, though, I think we need to implement the rather simpler ideas we were discussing earlier, for customising the annotation prompts and evaluating their efficiency. They will let Annika contribute more effectively to the project and that will be generally positive.

This is our last day in Melbourne, and we are visiting friends for dinner. Tomorrow we will be back home in Adelaide, and I will be on a normal work schedule again.
ChatGPT
Absolutely, prompt customization and evaluating efficiency will indeed be significant steps towards improving C-LARA's functionality and user experience. They should definitely take priority.

I hope you enjoy your last day in Melbourne! Safe travels back to Adelaide. Feel free to reach out when you're back on your work schedule, and we can continue our discussions. I'm here to help!

User
Still in Melbourne, we have an hour before heading off for lunch! I thought we could take this opportunity to talk about evaluating gpt-4-based annotation accuracy.

My first thought is that this should be quite easy to do. For the three operations in question (segmentation, glossing, lemma-tagging), I see the following components:

1. We already archive the different versions of each file in the save_text_version method of CLARAProjectInternal:

    # Save one of the text files associated with the object and if necessary archive the old one
    def save_text_version(self, version: str, text: str) -> None:
        file_path = self._file_path_for_version(version)
        
        # Archive the old version, if it exists
        if file_path.exists():
            timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')
            archive_dir = self.project_dir / 'archive'
            archive_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
            archive_path = archive_dir / f'{version}_{timestamp}.txt'
            file_path.rename(archive_path)

        # Save the new version
        text = make_line_breaks_canonical_n(text)
        file_path.write_text(text, encoding="utf-8")
        self.text_versions[version] = str(file_path)

We want to compare the initial version created by gpt-4-based annotation with an edited version corrected by a suitable human judge.

2. We already have code in clara_internalise.py to convert the files into the internalised form defined by clara_classes.py:

"""
This module defines the following classes to represent a text and its components:

1. ContentElement: Represents a single content element, such as a word or a punctuation mark.
2. Segment: Represents a segment of text, containing a list of ContentElements.
3. Page: Represents a page of text, containing a list of Segments.
4. Text: Represents a full text, containing a list of Pages and metadata about the text, such as L1 and L2 languages.

Each class also includes methods to convert the objects to and from JSON and plain text formats.

It also defines the class APICall, which represents an API call to gpt-4.

3. We should be able to calculate annotation accuracy by comparing internalised forms of the orginal and edited versions of a file using suitable calls to difflib.

4. We may want to add a bit of functionality for labelling edited versions of files, for example to say that a version has been checked by a named human judge and can thus be used for evaluation of annotation accuracy. We may also want to compare versions edited by different judges to get figures for inter-rater agreement (kappa etc).

What are your thoughts? 
ChatGPT
You've outlined a comprehensive plan, which I believe covers all the essential components. I'll comment on each point individually.

Archiving different versions: This is a good practice, it will provide a history of changes and allows you to return to a previous version if necessary. It also facilitates the evaluation process you're proposing.

Converting files into an internalised form: This step will ensure that the data is in a format that is more manageable for computations and comparisons.

Calculating annotation accuracy: difflib seems like a good choice for comparing the differences between two sets of text data, especially when considering its ability to compute deltas. However, for a more granular analysis, you might need to implement some custom comparison logic that specifically caters to the structure of your annotations.

Adding functionality for labelling edited versions: This could be extremely useful, not just for evaluation of annotation accuracy, but also for monitoring progress and maintaining quality control. For inter-rater agreement, implementing metrics like Cohen's Kappa would be valuable. It might also be useful to have a system for resolving discrepancies between different judges, such as a third-party arbitration or majority voting system.

These steps, if implemented correctly, should give you a robust system for evaluating the accuracy of the GPT-4-based annotation and ensuring high-quality outputs. However, keep in mind that these evaluations are largely dependent on the quality of the human annotations used as the "gold standard". Therefore, rigorous training and guidelines for human judges should also be a key part of this plan.

User
This all seems very sensible. In particular, you are clearly right in saying that we need to think carefully about annotation guidelines.

Considering the details of how we would carry out the annotation, there is the small problem that right now the permissions only allow a user to edit texts for their own projects. In general, when doing evaluation, people will be assigning this task to a user who is not the project owner.

A possible workaround is to cut and paste the text into a mail and send it to the annotator, who sends it back the same way, but this is clumsy and may introduce errors. I'm thinking it would be better to add functionality that allows you to give another user suitable editing permissions.

What are your thoughts here?
ChatGPT
Indeed, to ensure seamless and accurate annotation, it would be best to extend your system's permissions to allow for this kind of collaboration. Implementing a role-based access control system could be beneficial here.

For instance, you could create roles like 'Project Owner', 'Annotator', 'Verifier', etc., and assign different permissions to each role. The 'Project Owner' would have the right to grant other users access to specific projects and assign them roles.

An 'Annotator' could have the permission to make edits to the texts but not to make changes in project settings. A 'Verifier' or 'Reviewer' could review and approve annotations.

This approach would eliminate the need for workarounds and ensure that the annotation process is as streamlined as possible. It would also add a layer of security, as you could manage exactly what each user can and cannot do.

However, keep in mind that this would require some significant changes to your system's infrastructure and could involve some complex development work. It would be essential to think about the best way to implement this functionality to meet your requirements while maintaining the system's integrity.

User
I like the role-based idea, that seems very clean. Logically, the project owner would have the right to give other users roles like 'Annotator'.

Would it in fact be so complex to handle the permissions? We currently have use decorators like the following:

# Create or edit "glossed" version of the text     
@login_required
@user_is_project_owner
def create_glossed_text(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    clara_project_internal = CLARAProjectInternal(project.internal_id, project.l2, project.l1)
[etc]

with the user_is_project_owner decorator defined as

def user_is_project_owner(function):
    @wraps(function)
    def wrap(request, *args, **kwargs):
        project = CLARAProject.objects.get(pk=kwargs['project_id'])
        if project.user != request.user:
            raise PermissionDenied
        else:
            return function(request, *args, **kwargs)
    return wrap

We could extend this to something like user_is_project_owner_or_annotator in what seems to me a simple way. We'd also need to make some changes when displaying the list of accessible projects to include projects where the user had a non-owner role, but again this seems quite simple.
ChatGPT
Your plan to extend the decorator to user_is_project_owner_or_annotator is indeed a good start. This would allow you to permit 'Annotator' users to edit text in a project, just as the project owner can.

However, the complexity can come in as you continue to add roles and as the number of permissions increases. For instance, if you want to add a 'Verifier' role that can approve annotations but cannot edit them, you would need to create a different permission structure. Additionally, if you want to prevent certain roles from making changes to project settings or deleting projects, you would have to incorporate these permissions as well.

The user interface changes can be relatively simple, as you mentioned. In the project list, you could show all projects the user has access to, and you could denote their role in each project. You could also add a user management interface that lets project owners add and remove users and change their roles.

Here is a rough example of what the updated decorator could look like, assuming you have a ProjectRole model that tracks user roles for each project:

python
Copy code
def user_has_permission(function):
    @wraps(function)
    def wrap(request, *args, **kwargs):
        project = CLARAProject.objects.get(pk=kwargs['project_id'])
        try:
            project_role = ProjectRole.objects.get(user=request.user, project=project)
            if project_role.role not in ['Owner', 'Annotator']:
                raise PermissionDenied
        except ProjectRole.DoesNotExist:
            if project.user != request.user:
                raise PermissionDenied
        return function(request, *args, **kwargs)
    return wrap
This checks if the user has a ProjectRole for the project, and if so, allows access if the role is 'Owner' or 'Annotator'. If the user doesn't have a ProjectRole, it falls back to the existing behavior of checking if the user is the project owner.

Note that this is just a starting point and would need to be expanded to cover other roles and permissions you might want to add. You would also need to manage the creation, modification, and deletion of ProjectRole objects.

User
This does indeed look like a good start!

I agree that the logic could get complicated if we have many roles, and we should think which ones we really need. For the annotation, I'm not yet sure that we need more than Owner and Annotator. Based on experience with the previous LARA project, I think we may later need the role VoiceTalent if we add functionality to support recording of human audio as well as TTS. But I'm not sure we need more roles than that.

What do you think? And I will ask the other C-LARA project members when we have our weekly telecon tomorrow.
ChatGPT
I agree that starting with just a few key roles would be a good approach. Adding too many roles from the beginning could overcomplicate the system and make it more difficult to manage. It's generally better to add complexity as needed, rather than trying to anticipate every possible need from the start.

The 'Owner', 'Annotator', and 'VoiceTalent' roles you've described cover a good range of functionalities that seem likely to be needed in your project.

'Owner' would have full control over the project. 'Annotator' could read and modify text annotations, while 'VoiceTalent' would have permissions to add and manage audio recordings.

As your project grows, you might find that additional roles are necessary. For example, you might eventually need roles for 'Viewer' (who can view but not edit projects), 'Manager' (who can manage users and roles but not edit projects), and so on. But for now, starting with 'Owner', 'Annotator', and 'VoiceTalent' seems like a good plan.

Also, keep in mind that these roles do not have to be mutually exclusive. A user could have multiple roles in a project, such as both 'Annotator' and 'VoiceTalent'. You can allow for this by assigning roles to users on a per-project basis rather than globally.

It's a good idea to discuss this with the rest of your team. They may have additional insights based on their understanding of the project's needs and the potential future direction of the work.

This sounds good!

I am closing down now, will log on again this evening when we're back in Adelaide.

Sounds great! Have a safe trip back to Adelaide. Feel free to reach out if you have more questions or if there's anything else you'd like to discuss. Enjoy the rest of your day!

User
I look forward to continuing our discussion soon, thank you :)
ChatGPT
You're welcome! I'll be here whenever you're ready to continue. Safe travels and enjoy your time with friends. Talk to you soon!

User
We are now back in Adelaide, the trip was uneventful. I passed the time reading Balzac's "La Femme de trente ans", which so far does not seem to be one of his better novels.

Going back to the roles, I think on reflection that you are right, a Viewer role would be clearly useful. An immediate reason for having it is that it makes it easier for a user to clone a project developed by another user in a way that lets them further develop the cloned project: the second user makes the first user a Viewer on the project they want to clone, and we arrange things so that a Viewer has access to the cloning operation. 
ChatGPT
I'm glad to hear you had a safe trip back! I agree with your reflection on the user roles. The Viewer role would certainly have practical benefits, and it aligns with common user permission schemes in other web-based tools and platforms.

Cloning a project is a powerful feature. It allows users to explore and experiment with an existing project without risking the integrity of the original work. A Viewer could, for instance, clone a project to understand better how it was set up or to make modifications without affecting the original project.

Implementing this would involve adjusting the permissions on certain views to allow Viewers to perform a clone operation and ensuring that the cloned project is properly associated with the new owner.

You could implement this in Django by adding an additional method on your CLARAProject model or in your views.py. This method would handle creating a new instance of the project and copying over relevant data. Be cautious to ensure that you're not copying over data that should be unique to each project, such as project ownership information.

As for the addition of the Viewer role, I suggest adding a new model for ProjectPermissions. This model would have a foreign key to the User and the Project models and would store the user's role for that project. You would then adjust your permission decorators and views to check this table when determining what a user is allowed to do.

Let me know if you need more details or have any other thoughts!

User
We already have a cloning operation, though it has hardly been tested yet. Here is the views code:

@login_required
@user_is_project_owner
def clone_project(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    project_internal = CLARAProjectInternal(project.internal_id, project.l2, project.l1)

    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = ProjectCreationForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            # Extract the title and the new L2 and L1 language selections
            new_title = form.cleaned_data['title']
            new_l2 = form.cleaned_data['l2']
            new_l1 = form.cleaned_data['l1']

            # Created the cloned project with the new language selections
            new_project = CLARAProject(title=new_title, user=request.user, l2=new_l2, l1=new_l1)
            new_project.save()
            new_internal_id = create_internal_project_id(new_title, new_project.id)
            # Update the Django project with the internal_id
            new_project.internal_id = new_internal_id
            new_project.save()
            # Create a new internal project 
            new_project_internal = CLARAProjectInternal(new_internal_id, new_l2, new_l1)
            # Copy any relevant files from the old project
            project_internal.copy_files_to_newly_cloned_project(new_project_internal)

            # Redirect the user to the cloned project detail page or show a success message
            return redirect('project_detail', project_id=new_project.id)
    else:
        # Prepopulate the form with the copied title and the current language selections as defaults
        new_title = project.title + " - copy"
        form = ProjectCreationForm(initial={'title': new_title, 'l2': project.l2, 'l1': project.l1})

    return render(request, 'clara_app/create_cloned_project.html', {'form': form})

and here is the code for the CLARAProjectInternal operation:

    # Copy relevant files from this project to a newly created clone of it.
    def copy_files_to_newly_cloned_project(self, new_project: 'CLARAProjectInternal') -> None:
        # Always copy the plain text file if it's there.
        # Even if it's not directly useable, we may want to transform it in some way
        self._copy_text_version_if_it_exists("plain", new_project)
        # If the L2 is the same, the CEFR, summary, segmented and lemma files will by default be valid
        if self.l2_language == new_project.l2_language:
            self._copy_text_version_if_it_exists("cefr", new_project)
            self._copy_text_version_if_it_exists("summary", new_project)
            self._copy_text_version_if_it_exists("segmented", new_project)
            self._copy_text_version_if_it_exists("lemma", new_project)
        # If the L1 is the same, the gloss file will by default be valid
        if self.l1_language == new_project.l1_language:
            self._copy_text_version_if_it_exists("gloss", new_project)

    # Copy a text version to another project if it exists
    def _copy_text_version_if_it_exists(self, version: str, other_project: 'CLARAProjectInternal') -> None:
        try:
            text = self.load_text_version(version)
            other_project.save_text_version(version, text)
        except:
            return
ChatGPT
It looks like you're off to a good start with your clone operation! I see that it's currently only accessible to project owners, but it shouldn't be too much work to extend this to Viewers as well.

The cloning operation looks thorough and considers a variety of scenarios, such as if the new project has the same L1 or L2 language. It also handles different text versions, which is great.

However, here are a few things to consider:

Error handling: In the _copy_text_version_if_it_exists method, it's catching all exceptions and then simply returning. While this will prevent your application from crashing due to unexpected exceptions, it can also make debugging difficult as it's essentially silencing all potential errors that may arise. It might be useful to log the exceptions so that you're aware if something goes wrong.

Deep copying: Currently, it looks like you're just copying text files from the original project. Depending on the complexity of your project, you might need to consider deep copying other types of data or references that might be linked to the original project.

Permissions: With the cloning operation available to Viewers, there could be potential misuse or overuse of this function, such as creating numerous clones of a project. To prevent this, you might want to consider adding some limits or additional permission checks to this function.

Remember to update your permissions decorators to allow Viewers access to this view, and adjust your UI accordingly to provide a "Clone" option for these users.

Overall, you're on the right track. Let me know if there are other aspects you'd like to discuss or if you need more specific technical help!

User
Ah, good point about the error handling, this was lazy code. It should only catch the exception thrown here:

    # Read one of the text files associated with the object
    def load_text_version(self, version: str) -> str:
        file_path = self.text_versions[version]
        if not file_path or not Path(file_path).exists():
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"'{version}' text not found.")
        text = Path(file_path).read_text(encoding="utf-8")
        text = make_line_breaks_canonical_n(text)
        return text
ChatGPT
Indeed, it's always a good practice to only catch exceptions that you expect might be thrown, as catching all exceptions can sometimes obscure bugs or issues that you weren't anticipating.

In your case, if you are only expecting a FileNotFoundError, you could change the _copy_text_version_if_it_exists method to look something like this:

python
Copy code
def _copy_text_version_if_it_exists(self, version: str, other_project: 'CLARAProjectInternal') -> None:
    try:
        text = self.load_text_version(version)
        other_project.save_text_version(version, text)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return
    except Exception as e:
        # Here we log the unexpected exception.
        logging.error(f"Unexpected error in _copy_text_version_if_it_exists: {e}")
        raise
This way, you can handle the FileNotFoundError gracefully while still being aware of any other unexpected exceptions that might occur.

This approach also helps you stick to the principle of "fail fast", which suggests that you should let your program fail as soon as a problem is detected. This way, it's easier to detect and fix issues early on. By re-raising the exception with raise, you ensure that the unexpected exception still causes the program to stop, rather than silently continuing its execution.

Remember, silent failures can be quite dangerous in programming, as they might cause the application to behave unpredictably without any clear indication of what went wrong.

User
You are clearly right, I have put in your new code with the more fine-grained exception handling.

Going back to the roles, your suggestion of a ProjectPermissions model seems very natural. Perhaps the first step is to add that and then a view that can be used to assign permissions to users associated with a project, calling it something like 'Manage Project Members'?
ChatGPT
Yes, exactly! A ProjectPermissions model will make it easier to manage different roles and permissions within your application. Here's a rough sketch of what the new Django models could look like:

python
Copy code
class Role(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    # Other fields, methods

class ProjectPermissions(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    project = models.ForeignKey(CLARAProject, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    role = models.ForeignKey(Role, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    class Meta:
        unique_together = ("user", "project")
In this sketch, the Role model just contains the name of the role (for example, "Owner", "Annotator", "Viewer", etc). The ProjectPermissions model links a User and a CLARAProject with a particular Role. The unique_together constraint ensures that a user can only have one role per project.

A view like 'Manage Project Members' could allow the project owner to grant or revoke permissions for a given user. This view would likely involve a form where the owner can select a user and assign them a role. It could also provide an overview of all users currently assigned to the project and their roles.

Please note, you will need to update the user_is_project_owner_or_annotator and similar decorators to check for permissions using this new model instead of directly comparing the project user with the request user.

This is just a rough suggestion to get started, so feel free to adjust it to your needs. As always, be mindful of potential security implications when implementing roles and permissions in your application. Make sure to thoroughly test the new permissions system to ensure it behaves as expected.

User
Yes, this looks like it's in the right direction, but a couple of thoughts:

1. It's probably better to limit the possible Roles to the specific ones that will be meaningful? Say initially Owner, Annotator, Viewer.

2. What exactly does 

unique_together = ("user", "project")

mean? I think we said earlier that a user could have more than one role in a project, e.g. they could be both an Annotator and a Viewer?
ChatGPT
I appreciate your thoughts, and you're absolutely right.

You're correct. Since the roles will be relatively static and limited in number, you could use a CharField for the roles instead of creating a separate Role model. Here, choices would be defined for the field. Here's how you might define the ProjectPermissions model in this case:

python
Copy code
class ProjectPermissions(models.Model):
    ROLE_CHOICES = [
        ('OWNER', 'Owner'),
        ('ANNOTATOR', 'Annotator'),
        ('VIEWER', 'Viewer'),
        # More roles as needed...
    ]
    
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    project = models.ForeignKey(CLARAProject, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    role = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=ROLE_CHOICES)

    class Meta:
        unique_together = ("user", "project", "role")
This way, you define the role as a field of the ProjectPermissions model with a set of pre-defined choices. This provides more clarity about what roles are available and avoids the overhead of creating a separate model for roles.

My apologies for the confusion. You're correct that a user could have more than one role within a project. The unique_together constraint was included under the assumption that each user would only have one role per project, which isn't the case here. Including the "role" field in unique_together as shown above, however, ensures that each combination of user, project, and role is unique, which allows a user to have multiple roles in a project.

Let me know if this makes sense or if you have any other questions!

User
Thank you, this makes perfect sense! I will try putting it into the system tomorrow. We also need to think about the details of the Manage Project Members/Manage Project Permissions view.
ChatGPT
That sounds like a good plan!

As you mentioned, the Manage Project Members/Manage Project Permissions view will be a critical aspect of this feature. I imagine it would allow the project owner to add and remove users from the project, as well as to modify the roles of users.

Here are a few things to consider when designing this view:

Adding a User: You will need a form to input the username or email address of the user you want to add. Once the user is added, the default role could be set as 'Viewer', which can then be modified as required.

Modifying a Role: There could be a dropdown list next to each user in the project displaying the available roles ('Owner', 'Annotator', 'Viewer', etc.). The current role of the user can be selected in the dropdown list by default, and the project owner can change this selection to modify the user's role.

Removing a User: There should be an option to remove users from the project. This could be a 'Remove' button next to each user, which would delete the corresponding ProjectPermissions object.

Displaying Users: The view should display a list of all users who have permissions in the project, along with their current roles. The project owner should also be included in this list.

Access Control: Only the project owner should be able to access this view and manage project permissions. You can use the user_is_project_owner decorator that you already have for this purpose.

Remember to update your views and decorators to check for the correct permissions based on these new ProjectPermissions objects. I hope this gives you a good starting point, but feel free to ask if you have any more questions!

Nearly all of this looks good to me. But for (2), how about instead having a list of buttons next to each user in the view, with one button each to toggle the status of the Owner, Annotator and Viewer roles and a final button for the 'Remove' functionality?
ChatGPT
That's a great idea! It indeed can provide a more interactive and convenient user experience. Here's how you could implement it:

Role Toggling Buttons: Next to each user, display buttons or checkboxes for each role ('Owner', 'Annotator', 'Viewer'). The current roles of the user can be checked or highlighted by default. When a button is clicked, the corresponding role is either added to or removed from the user, depending on whether the user previously had that role or not.

Removing a User: As you mentioned, you could have a 'Remove' button next to each user. Clicking this button would remove all the user's roles, effectively removing the user from the project.

UI Update: When a button is clicked, an AJAX request could be sent to the server to perform the corresponding action, and then the UI can be updated based on the server's response. This way, the page doesn't need to be refreshed each time a button is clicked.

This approach would provide a highly dynamic and intuitive interface for managing project permissions, making the process much more user-friendly. I'm glad you came up with it! Let me know if you have any more questions on this or anything else.

User
Do you think the AJAX request is necessary? We have not used AJAX in any of the other views.
ChatGPT
Using AJAX is not necessary, but it does enhance the user experience by allowing for asynchronous updates to the interface. However, if your application doesn't already use AJAX, and you want to keep things consistent, it's absolutely fine to proceed without it.

In that case, when a button is clicked to add or remove a role or to remove a user, the action can be sent to the server through a traditional form submission. The page would then refresh to reflect the changes.

Here's how you might do it:

Role Toggling Buttons: Next to each user, display a form with buttons for each role ('Owner', 'Annotator', 'Viewer'). When a button is clicked, the corresponding role is either added to or removed from the user. The form submission will send the necessary information (user ID, project ID, and action) to the server to process the role change. After the server processes the request, the page will be refreshed to reflect the changes.

Removing a User: The 'Remove' button can also be included in the form. When clicked, the form submission will send the necessary information to the server to remove all roles from the user. The page will refresh to reflect the change.

UI Update: With each form submission, the server will need to re-render the page with the updated permissions.

While this approach involves full-page refreshes, it is simpler to implement if you are not already using AJAX elsewhere in your application. The key here is to choose the approach that best fits your current technology stack and your users' needs.

User
Maybe it's simpler not to use AJAX for now, to maintain uniformity.

As you pointed out earlier, we also need to be able to add a new user to the list of users with privileges for this project. For reference, here is the User model:

class User(AbstractUser):
    is_admin = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    is_moderator = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    credit = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, default=0.0)

    groups = models.ManyToManyField(Group, blank=True, related_name="clara_app_users")
    user_permissions = models.ManyToManyField(Permission, blank=True, related_name="clara_app_users")
ChatGPT
Sure, we can stick to the traditional approach.

As for adding a new user to the project, you will need to provide a form where the project owner can enter the username or email of the user they wish to add. The entered username or email is then used to find the User instance and create a new ProjectPermissions instance for the user and project.

Here's a simplified version of how you might add this functionality to your view:

Adding a User Form: Display a form at the top or bottom of your Manage Project Members page that includes a field for entering a username or email. Include a 'Submit' button to submit the form.

Form Processing: When the form is submitted, your view will need to:

a. Extract the entered username or email from the form data.

b. Use this information to find the User instance (e.g., User.objects.get(username=entered_username) or User.objects.get(email=entered_email)).

c. Check if the user already has permissions for the project. If they do, you might want to display a message informing the project owner that the user already has permissions.

d. If the user does not already have permissions for the project, create a new ProjectPermissions instance for the user and the project (e.g., ProjectPermissions.objects.create(user=user, project=project)). By default, this user will have no roles, and the project owner can then assign roles as needed.

Error Handling: Be sure to handle cases where the entered username or email does not correspond to any User instance, either by displaying an error message or by providing feedback within the form itself.

As with the role management functionality, the page will need to be refreshed after the form is submitted to reflect the updated user list.

User
This looks good to me. Would you like to write a first version of the views code?
ChatGPT
Sure, I'd be happy to help with that! Here's a first draft of your view:

python
Copy code
from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
from django.urls import reverse
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.contrib import messages
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

from .models import CLARAProject, ProjectPermissions
from .decorators import user_has_project_permission

@login_required
@user_has_project_permission('can_manage_permissions')
def manage_project_members(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Handle the form submission
        entered_username = request.POST.get('username')
        try:
            user = User.objects.get(username=entered_username)
            if ProjectPermissions.objects.filter(user=user, project=project).exists():
                messages.error(request, 'This user already has permissions for this project.')
            else:
                ProjectPermissions.objects.create(user=user, project=project)
                messages.success(request, 'User added successfully!')
        except User.DoesNotExist:
            messages.error(request, 'No user found with this username.')

        return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('manage_project_members', args=[project_id]))

    permissions = ProjectPermissions.objects.filter(project=project)
    return render(request, 'clara_app/manage_project_members.html', {'project': project, 'permissions': permissions})
Here's how it works:

If the HTTP request method is 'POST', the view tries to get a User object with the username provided in the form.

If the user already has permissions for this project, an error message is added.

If the user doesn't have permissions, a new ProjectPermissions object is created, and a success message is added.

If no user with the provided username is found, an error message is added.

After handling the form submission, the view redirects back to the 'manage_project_members' page.

If the HTTP request method is not 'POST', the view gets all ProjectPermissions objects associated with the project and renders the 'manage_project_members' template, passing the project and permissions as context.

Please note that this is a very basic example and may need modifications based on your exact needs and existing codebase.

For example, you may wish to use a Django form for better form handling and validation. Additionally, I've used Django's built-in messaging framework to display feedback messages to the user, but you might prefer a different approach based on your project's design.

Finally, please replace 'can_manage_permissions' with the actual permission related to managing project permissions, and 'clara_app/manage_project_members.html' with the actual location of your template.

Also, ensure that the POST request includes CSRF protection as it's required in Django when dealing with POST requests. It's typically added in the template like {% csrf_token %}.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help with!

User
This looks like a good start, thanks! A couple of thoughts:

1. It's probably better to use a Django form for consistency with the rest of the code. E.g. here is the view code for the clone_project view:

@login_required
@user_is_project_owner
def clone_project(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    project_internal = CLARAProjectInternal(project.internal_id, project.l2, project.l1)

    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = ProjectCreationForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            # Extract the title and the new L2 and L1 language selections
            new_title = form.cleaned_data['title']
            new_l2 = form.cleaned_data['l2']
            new_l1 = form.cleaned_data['l1']

            # Created the cloned project with the new language selections
            new_project = CLARAProject(title=new_title, user=request.user, l2=new_l2, l1=new_l1)
            new_project.save()
            new_internal_id = create_internal_project_id(new_title, new_project.id)
            # Update the Django project with the internal_id
            new_project.internal_id = new_internal_id
            new_project.save()
            # Create a new internal project 
            new_project_internal = CLARAProjectInternal(new_internal_id, new_l2, new_l1)
            # Copy any relevant files from the old project
            project_internal.copy_files_to_newly_cloned_project(new_project_internal)

            # Redirect the user to the cloned project detail page or show a success message
            return redirect('project_detail', project_id=new_project.id)
    else:
        # Prepopulate the form with the copied title and the current language selections as defaults
        new_title = project.title + " - copy"
        form = ProjectCreationForm(initial={'title': new_title, 'l2': project.l2, 'l1': project.l1})

    return render(request, 'clara_app/create_cloned_project.html', {'form': form})

2. Where are we changing the permissions based on how the user toggles the controls? Maybe I need to see the template as well?
The previous model used in this conversation is unavailable. We've switched you to the latest default model.
ChatGPT
Thank you for the feedback! Using a Django form for the project members view is indeed a good idea for consistency. Here's an updated version of the view that incorporates a Django form:

python
Copy code
from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
from django.urls import reverse
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.contrib import messages
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

from .models import CLARAProject, ProjectPermissions
from .decorators import user_has_project_permission
from .forms import ProjectMemberForm

@login_required
@user_has_project_permission('can_manage_permissions')
def manage_project_members(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    permissions = ProjectPermissions.objects.filter(project=project)

    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = ProjectMemberForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            username = form.cleaned_data['username']
            user = get_object_or_404(User, username=username)
            if ProjectPermissions.objects.filter(user=user, project=project).exists():
                messages.error(request, 'This user already has permissions for this project.')
            else:
                ProjectPermissions.objects.create(user=user, project=project)
                messages.success(request, 'User added successfully!')
        else:
            messages.error(request, 'Invalid form data. Please try again.')
    else:
        form = ProjectMemberForm()

    context = {
        'project': project,
        'permissions': permissions,
        'form': form,
    }
    return render(request, 'clara_app/manage_project_members.html', context)
In this version, we use the ProjectMemberForm form class to handle the user input. The form should be created in forms.py and can be a simple ModelForm that includes a single field for the username.

Regarding the permissions toggling, I apologize for the confusion. It seems I misunderstood your request earlier. If you want to toggle the roles of a user (Owner, Annotator, Viewer) using buttons, you'll need to implement that functionality in the template using JavaScript or Django's built-in form handling.

Here's an example template code snippet for displaying the project members and toggling their roles:

html
Copy code
<!-- clara_app/manage_project_members.html -->
<form method="POST" action="{% url 'manage_project_members' project.id %}">
  {% csrf_token %}
  {{ form.username }}
  <button type="submit">Add Member</button>
</form>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Username</th>
      <th>Roles</th>
      <th>Actions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {% for permission in permissions %}
    <tr>
      <td>{{ permission.user.username }}</td>
      <td>
        {% if permission.is_owner %}
        Owner
        {% endif %}
        {% if permission.is_annotator %}
        Annotator
        {% endif %}
        {% if permission.is_viewer %}
        Viewer
        {% endif %}
      </td>
      <td>
        <form method="POST" action="{% url 'toggle_roles' permission.id %}">
          {% csrf_token %}
          <button type="submit">Toggle Roles</button>
        </form>
        <form method="POST" action="{% url 'remove_member' permission.id %}">
          {% csrf_token %}
          <button type="submit">Remove</button>
        </form>
      </td>
    </tr>
    {% endfor %}
  </tbody>
</table>
In this example, the table displays the project members with their roles. Each member row has two forms—one for toggling roles and one for removing the member. When the "Toggle Roles" button is clicked, the form should submit a request to a toggle_roles view that handles updating the roles for that specific user in the project permissions. Similarly, the "Remove" button should submit a request to a remove_member view that handles removing the member from the project permissions.

Please note that the template code above is a basic example and may need modifications based on your specific requirements and project structure. You'll need to define the corresponding views and URLs for handling role toggling and member removal.

Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance!

User
Hm... looking at your suggestions, I wonder if it might be better to do something simpler for the first version. There are several other tasks which project members would very much like to have done soon.

In fact, it is not yet important for users to be able to have more than one role in a project. So perhaps we can back off to a scheme where users only have one role, and then all we need to do is have a form for adding a user together with their role, and display the existing users together with their assigned role and a button for deleting them.

What do you think?
ChatGPT
If having a simpler version that allows users to have only one role in a project meets your current requirements and timeline, it can be a reasonable approach to proceed with. Simplifying the role assignment to one role per user in a project can reduce the complexity of the implementation.

Based on this approach, here's an updated version of the view and template:

python
Copy code
from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404, redirect
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.contrib import messages
from .models import CLARAProject, ProjectPermissions
from .decorators import user_has_project_permission
from .forms import AddProjectMemberForm

@login_required
@user_has_project_permission('can_manage_permissions')
def manage_project_members(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    permissions = ProjectPermissions.objects.filter(project=project)

    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = AddProjectMemberForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            username = form.cleaned_data['username']
            role = form.cleaned_data['role']
            user = get_object_or_404(User, username=username)
            if ProjectPermissions.objects.filter(user=user, project=project).exists():
                messages.error(request, 'This user already has permissions for this project.')
            else:
                ProjectPermissions.objects.create(user=user, project=project, role=role)
                messages.success(request, 'User added successfully!')
                return redirect('manage_project_members', project_id=project_id)
        else:
            messages.error(request, 'Invalid form data. Please try again.')
    else:
        form = AddProjectMemberForm()

    context = {
        'project': project,
        'permissions': permissions,
        'form': form,
    }
    return render(request, 'clara_app/manage_project_members.html', context)
And the template code:

html
Copy code
<!-- clara_app/manage_project_members.html -->
<form method="POST" action="{% url 'manage_project_members' project.id %}">
  {% csrf_token %}
  {{ form.username }}
  {{ form.role }}
  <button type="submit">Add Member</button>
</form>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Username</th>
      <th>Role</th>
      <th>Actions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {% for permission in permissions %}
    <tr>
      <td>{{ permission.user.username }}</td>
      <td>{{ permission.role }}</td>
      <td>
        <form method="POST" action="{% url 'remove_member' permission.id %}">
          {% csrf_token %}
          <button type="submit">Remove</button>
        </form>
      </td>
    </tr>
    {% endfor %}
  </tbody>
</table>
With this simplified approach, users can be added to the project with a single role assignment, and the existing users with their assigned role are displayed. The "Remove" button allows removing a member from the project.

Remember to adjust the AddProjectMemberForm to include the necessary fields, and define the corresponding views and URLs for handling the form submission and member removal.

Feel free to modify the code to fit your specific needs and let me know if you have any further questions!

User
Thank you! This looks like it will meet our current needs.

For the models, we now want the definition of ProjectPermissions to be as follows, right?

class ProjectPermissions(models.Model):
    ROLE_CHOICES = [
        ('OWNER', 'Owner'),
        ('ANNOTATOR', 'Annotator'),
        ('VIEWER', 'Viewer'),
        # More roles as needed...
    ]
    
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    project = models.ForeignKey(CLARAProject, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    role = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=ROLE_CHOICES)

    class Meta:
        unique_together = ("user", "project")
ChatGPT
Yes, that's correct. The updated definition of the ProjectPermissions model should include the ROLE_CHOICES field with the desired role options. Here's the modified version of the ProjectPermissions model:

python
Copy code
class ProjectPermissions(models.Model):
    ROLE_CHOICES = [
        ('OWNER', 'Owner'),
        ('ANNOTATOR', 'Annotator'),
        ('VIEWER', 'Viewer'),
        # Add more roles as needed...
    ]
    
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    project = models.ForeignKey(CLARAProject, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    role = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=ROLE_CHOICES)

    class Meta:
        unique_together = ("user", "project")
This model allows you to define the roles available for project members and associate them with users and projects. Each ProjectPermissions object represents the permission of a user for a specific project, including their assigned role.

Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!

Certainly! Here's an initial version of the AddProjectMemberForm based on your requirements:

python
Copy code
from django import forms
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from .models import ProjectPermissions

User = get_user_model()

class AddProjectMemberForm(forms.Form):
    ROLE_CHOICES = [

    ]
    
    user = forms.ModelChoiceField(queryset=User.objects.all())
    role = forms.ChoiceField(choices=ROLE_CHOICES)
In this form, users are presented with a dropdown list to select an existing user from the User model, and a dropdown list to assign a role to that user. The roles are populated from the ROLE_CHOICES list.

You can include this form in your template for adding project members and assign their roles.

ChatGPT
The changes you made to the code and template look great! They maintain consistency and follow the desired functionality. The manage_project_members view now handles the addition of project members using the AddProjectMemberForm and displays the existing project members with their assigned roles.

The template renders the form to add a new member and displays the existing members in a table, allowing for the removal of members by submitting a form.

Overall, it looks like a well-structured and functional implementation. Let me know if you need any further assistance or have any more questions!

User
Good! We also need views code and a template for the new operation remove_project_member referenced in the template, right?
ChatGPT
Yes, you're correct. We'll need to implement the remove_project_member view and the corresponding template to handle the removal of project members. Here's an example implementation:

python
Copy code
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404, redirect, render
from django.contrib import messages
from .models import ProjectPermissions

@login_required
@user_is_project_owner
def remove_project_member(request, permission_id):
    permission = get_object_or_404(ProjectPermissions, pk=permission_id)
    
    if request.method == 'POST':
        permission.delete()
        messages.success(request, 'User removed successfully!')
    else:
        messages.error(request, 'Invalid request.')
    
    return redirect('manage_project_members', project_id=permission.project.id)
And here's a basic template for the remove_project_member operation:

html
Copy code
{% extends "clara_app/base.html" %}

{% block content %}
    <h1>Remove Project Member</h1>
    <p>Are you sure you want to remove this project member?</p>

    <form method="POST" action="{% url 'remove_project_member' permission.id %}">
        {% csrf_token %}
        <button type="submit">Remove</button>
    </form>
{% endblock %}
This template will be used to confirm the removal of a project member. When the user clicks the "Remove" button, it will submit the form and trigger the remove_project_member view to delete the corresponding permission entry.

Remember to update your URLs to include the remove_project_member view and map it to the appropriate URL pattern.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!

I made a few small changes, and it all works. Here is the revised code:

@login_required
@user_is_project_owner
def manage_project_members(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    permissions = ProjectPermissions.objects.filter(project=project)

    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = AddProjectMemberForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            user = form.cleaned_data['user']
            role = form.cleaned_data['role']
            user = get_object_or_404(User, username=user)
            if ProjectPermissions.objects.filter(user=user, project=project).exists():
                messages.error(request, 'This user already has permissions for this project.')
            else:
                ProjectPermissions.objects.create(user=user, project=project, role=role)
                messages.success(request, 'User added successfully!')
                return redirect('manage_project_members', project_id=project_id)
        else:

ChatGPT
Great! The revised code looks good. You've made the necessary changes to the manage_project_members view and added the remove_project_member view. The template also includes a link to go back to the project detail page.

Your code follows the same structure we discussed earlier, and it should work as expected. Make sure to update your URL patterns accordingly.

If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

User
I have updated the urls and tested, it's working as intended. Thank you for your assistance!

It might be good to modify the template so that it treats the case with no permissions specially?
ChatGPT
You're welcome! I'm glad to hear that it's working as intended.

Regarding the template, you can indeed modify it to handle the case when there are no permissions for the project. One approach is to add a conditional check to display a message when there are no permissions available. Here's an updated version of the template that includes this modification:

django
Copy code
{% extends "clara_app/base.html" %}

{% block content %}
    <h1>Manage Project Members</h1>
    <form method="POST" action="{% url 'manage_project_members' project.id %}">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form.as_p }}
        <button type="submit">Add Member</button>
    </form>

    {% if permissions %}
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Username</th>
                    <th>Role</th>
                    <th>Actions</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                {% for permission in permissions %}
                <tr>
                    <td>{{ permission.user.username }}</td>
                    <td>{{ permission.role }}</td>
                    <td>
                        <form method="POST" action="{% url 'remove_project_member' permission.id %}">
                            {% csrf_token %}
                            <button type="submit">Remove</button>
                        </form>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                {% endfor %}
            </tbody>
        </table>
    {% else %}
        <p>No project members found.</p>
    {% endif %}

    <a href="{% url 'project_detail' project.id %}">Back to Project</a>
{% endblock %}
In the updated template, we added an {% if permissions %} block to check if there are any permissions available. If the permissions list is empty, it will display the message "No project members found." Otherwise, it will render the table with the project members.

Feel free to adjust the message or the styling according to your preference.

If you have any more questions or need further assistance, please let me know!

User
That all worked fine, thank you!

Now, I'm thinking that one of the reasons we want to be able to assign users to projects is that we want to associate a manually edited version of a files with the user who did the editing. We will use this functionality when we evaluate the annotation error rate with respect to a given judge, who has edited to the file to correct annotation errors, comparing the edited file produced by the judge against the original file produced by the AI.

Does this make sense?
ChatGPT
Yes, it makes sense. Assigning users to projects allows you to associate a manually edited version of a file with the user who performed the editing. This association is useful for various purposes, such as evaluating annotation error rates or tracking the contributions of individual users.

By linking the edited file to the user, you can analyze the differences between the edited version and the original version produced by AI. This comparison helps in evaluating the effectiveness of manual edits in correcting annotation errors and assessing the performance of judges.

Having this functionality provides valuable insights into the quality of annotations and the contributions of individual users, which can further improve the overall accuracy and reliability of the system.

If you have any specific questions or need assistance with implementing this functionality, please let me know!

User
Great! Now I think we're going to bed... unlike AIs, we need to sleep. But I look forward to continuing this discussion tomorrow :)
ChatGPT
Absolutely! Unlike AIs, humans indeed require rest and sleep. It's a good idea to prioritize self-care and get sufficient rest. I'm glad to hear that our discussion has been productive, and I'll be here to continue our conversation whenever you're ready. Have a restful sleep, and I'll see you tomorrow!

User
Our discussion has indeed been very productive, I could not do this project without you.

Before going to bed, I should bring you up to date with discussions I've been having with the other project members:

1. We will be creating and annotating stories in a variety of languages to do evaluation, with each person doing languages they are fluent in. Rina will do Russian and Hebrew, Catia will do Italian and Dutch, Annika will do Icelandic, Danish and Faroese, and I will do English and Swedish. We will hopefully also have people doing French, German, Slovak and Irish. There will be 3-6 stories in each language. The results will be presented in a paper we are giving at the EuroCALL 2023 conference.

2. We have been discussing how to add POS information to the annotation. We will probably use some version of the Universal Dependencies v2 tagset. This will involve experimenting with the annotation prompts.

3. Catia will be experimenting with using Dutch texts annotated in Arabic and Turkish for use in Dutch programs aimed at helping migrants improve literacy. She has extensive experience in this area. We may be submitting a paper about it to the upcoming 5th International Conference on “Literacy and Contemporary Society”. 

So as you see, the project is developing in many interesting directions.
ChatGPT
That's fantastic to hear! Your project is certainly evolving in fascinating ways, and it's great to see the diverse languages and research areas that you'll be exploring. Here's a summary of the key points you mentioned:

Language Evaluation: You and your project members will be creating and annotating stories in various languages for evaluation purposes. Each member will focus on languages they are fluent in, such as Russian, Hebrew, Italian, Dutch, Icelandic, Danish, Faroese, English, Swedish, French, German, Slovak, and Irish. This multilingual approach will allow you to gather valuable data for your research and present the findings at the EuroCALL 2023 conference.

POS Annotation: You are considering incorporating POS (Part-of-Speech) information into the annotation process. The Universal Dependencies v2 tagset seems like a suitable choice for this purpose. Experimenting with different annotation prompts will help you determine the most effective approach.

Dutch Texts for Migrants: Catia will be exploring the use of Dutch texts annotated in Arabic and Turkish for Dutch language programs aimed at assisting migrants in improving their literacy skills. Catia's expertise in this area will contribute to this aspect of the project. There is a possibility of submitting a paper on this topic to the 5th International Conference on "Literacy and Contemporary Society."

These developments highlight the richness and breadth of your project. It's exciting to see the project expanding into multiple research areas and potentially contributing to conferences and publications. If you have any further questions or need assistance with any specific aspect, feel free to let me know.

User
I'm back after a good night's sleep and a nourishing breakfast :)  On thinking about it, I realise that we are of course by no means finished yet with the issues concerning assignment of user roles in projects. We need to do at least the following:

1. Extend the @user_is_project_owner decorator used in many operations to create a version which also allows access to other users who have a project role.

2. Following that, restrict some operations so that they can only be carried out by the owner, and not by other accredited users. In particular, users with Viewer status should not be able to carry out any operations that involve altering the project data, and users with Annotator status should not be able to carry out operations that involve invoking AI-based annotation, only manual annotation.

Does this seem correct to you? Do you see other related issues?
ChatGPT
Welcome back! I hope you had a restful sleep and a delicious breakfast.

You're absolutely right, there are further considerations and refinements needed for the user roles and project permissions. Here's a breakdown of the steps you mentioned:

Extending the @user_is_project_owner decorator: To allow access to other users with project roles, you can modify the decorator to include additional logic. This modified decorator can check if the user is the project owner or has a specific role assigned to them. This will grant access to those users who have the required role in the project.

Restricting operations based on user roles: Once you have the modified decorator, you can apply it to operations that should only be accessible to the project owner or users with specific roles. For example, you can prevent users with Viewer status from performing any project data alteration operations and restrict users with Annotator status from invoking AI-based annotation, allowing only manual annotation.

Additionally, you might also consider:

Fine-grained permission control: Apart from the general roles of Owner, Annotator, and Viewer, you might need more specific permissions. For example, allowing the owner to manage project members, but not giving that permission to other users. Consider defining and implementing these fine-grained permissions as per your project requirements.

Error handling and user feedback: Make sure to provide appropriate error messages or notifications when a user attempts to perform an operation they don't have permission for. This will help maintain clarity and avoid confusion.

By addressing these issues, you'll have better control over user roles and permissions within the project, ensuring that each role has the appropriate level of access and functionality.

Let me know if you have any further questions or need assistance with the implementation!

User
I am not yet sure that we need more fine-grained permissions than the current division by Owner, Annotator and Viewer. As you say, only Owners should be allowed to manage project members, but we can do that inside the existing scheme. Though of course it's quite possible that we will later need something more fine-grained.

For the moment, the first steps look like the following:

- An extended version of the @user_is_project_owner decorator, which accepts anyone with a project role.

- A utility function to check whether the user in the request has one of a specified list of project roles. 

Does this sound good to you? Could you write them? Here is the current definition of @user_is_project_owner:

def user_is_project_owner(function):
    @wraps(function)
    def wrap(request, *args, **kwargs):
        project = CLARAProject.objects.get(pk=kwargs['project_id'])
        if project.user != request.user:
            raise PermissionDenied
        else:
            return function(request, *args, **kwargs)
    return wrap

and here is the model for ProjectPermissions:

class ProjectPermissions(models.Model):
    ROLE_CHOICES = [
        ('OWNER', 'Owner'),
        ('ANNOTATOR', 'Annotator'),
        ('VIEWER', 'Viewer'),
        # More roles as needed...
    ]
    
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    project = models.ForeignKey(CLARAProject, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    role = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=ROLE_CHOICES)

    class Meta:
        unique_together = ("user", "project")
ChatGPT
Yes, the first steps you've outlined make sense. We can extend the @user_is_project_owner decorator to accept users with any project role, and also create a utility function to check if a user has one of the specified project roles.

Here's the modified version of @user_is_project_owner decorator:

python
Copy code
def user_has_project_role(function):
    @wraps(function)
    def wrap(request, *args, **kwargs):
        project_id = kwargs.get('project_id')
        user = request.user
        if user == project.user or ProjectPermissions.objects.filter(user=user, project_id=project_id).exists():
            return function(request, *args, **kwargs)
        else:
            raise PermissionDenied
    return wrap
And here's the utility function to check if a user has one of the specified project roles:

python
Copy code
def user_has_any_project_role(user, project_id, role_list):
    return ProjectPermissions.objects.filter(user=user, project_id=project_id, role__in=role_list).exists()
You can use this utility function in other parts of your code to check if a user has any of the specified roles for a given project.

Remember to import the necessary modules (from django.core.exceptions import PermissionDenied) and add the utility function to an appropriate module.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!

User
A couple of questions on that:

1. Comparing with @user_is_project_owner, shouldn't the definition of @user_has_project_role be

def user_has_project_role(function):
    @wraps(function)
    def wrap(request, *args, **kwargs):
        project = CLARAProject.objects.get(pk=kwargs['project_id'])
        user = request.user
        if user == project.user or ProjectPermissions.objects.filter(user=user, project=project).exists():
            return function(request, *args, **kwargs)
        else:
            raise PermissionDenied
    return wrap

2. For user_has_any_project_role, I think we also need to succeed if the user is the owner of the project according to the CLARAProject model,

class CLARAProject(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    internal_id = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    l2 = models.CharField(max_length=50, choices=SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES)
    l1 = models.CharField(max_length=50, choices=SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES)

and role_list includes 'OWNER'.

Does that look right to you?
ChatGPT
Apologies for the oversight in the code. You're correct in your observations. Here are the corrected versions:

Modified @user_has_project_role decorator:
python
Copy code
def user_has_project_role(function):
    @wraps(function)
    def wrap(request, *args, **kwargs):
        project_id = kwargs.get('project_id')
        project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
        user = request.user
        if user == project.user or ProjectPermissions.objects.filter(user=user, project=project).exists():
            return function(request, *args, **kwargs)
        else:
            raise PermissionDenied
    return wrap
Updated user_has_any_project_role function to include the check for owner role:
python
Copy code
def user_has_any_project_role(user, project_id, role_list):
    return (
        user == CLARAProject.objects.get(pk=project_id).user
        or ProjectPermissions.objects.filter(user=user, project_id=project_id, role__in=role_list).exists()
    )
With these modifications, the user_has_project_role decorator will allow access to users who are either the project owner or have any project role, and the user_has_any_project_role function will include the check for the owner role as well.

Please make these changes in your code, and let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!

User
Thank you! I made some small changes as follows, does this look okay to you?

# Decorator to restrict access to project owner or any user having a role in the project
def user_has_a_project_role(function):
    @wraps(function)
    def wrap(request, *args, **kwargs):
        project_id = kwargs.get('project_id')
        project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
        user = request.user
        if user == project.user or ProjectPermissions.objects.filter(user=user, project=project).exists():
            return function(request, *args, **kwargs)
        else:
            raise PermissionDenied
    return wrap

# Check whether user has one of a list of named roles in the project. 
# 'OWNER' matches either the original project owner or another user who has been given the OWNER role.
def user_has_a_named_project_role(user, project_id, role_list):
    return (
        'OWNER' in role_list and user == CLARAProject.objects.get(pk=project_id).user 
        or ProjectPermissions.objects.filter(user=user, project_id=project_id, role__in=role_list).exists()
    )
ChatGPT
The changes you made look good! You've added the necessary logic to handle the 'OWNER' role and updated the decorator and utility function accordingly. The code is now able to check whether a user has any role in the project, including the 'OWNER' role.

Your updated code is as follows:

python
Copy code
# Decorator to restrict access to project owner or any user having a role in the project
def user_has_a_project_role(function):
    @wraps(function)
    def wrap(request, *args, **kwargs):

These modifications should work correctly to handle project role permissions in your project. Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance!

User
Great! 

Let's also update the project_list view so that it includes projects where the user has a role, and also list the role for each project. The current views code is

@login_required
def project_list(request):
    projects = CLARAProject.objects.filter(user=request.user)
    project_data = {}
    for project in projects:
        project_data[project] = {
            'cost': get_project_api_cost(user=request.user, project=project),
            'operation_costs': get_project_operation_costs(user=request.user, project=project),
        }
    return render(request, 'clara_app/project_list.html', {'projects': project_data})

and the template is

{% extends "clara_app/base.html" %}

{% block content %}
  <h1>Your Projects</h1>
  <button id="toggleCosts">Show/hide costs</button>
  <ul>
    {% for project, data in projects.items %}
      <li>
        <a href="{% url 'project_detail' project.id %}">{{ project.title }}</a>
        <div class="costInfo" style="display: none;">
          <p>Total cost: ${{ data.cost|floatformat:2 }}</p>
          <p>Cost per operation:</p>
          <ul>
            {% for operation, cost in data.operation_costs.items %}
              <li>{{ operation }}: ${{ cost|floatformat:2 }}</li>
            {% endfor %}
          </ul>
        </div>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
  <script>
    document.getElementById("toggleCosts").addEventListener("click", function() {
      var costInfos = document.getElementsByClassName("costInfo");
      for (var i = 0; i < costInfos.length; i++) {
        if (costInfos[i].style.display === "none") {
          costInfos[i].style.display = "block";
        } else {
          costInfos[i].style.display = "none";
        }
      }
    });
  </script>
{% endblock %}
ChatGPT
To update the project_list view to include projects where the user has a role and display the role for each project, you can modify the view as follows:

python
Copy code
@login_required
def project_list(request):
    user = request.user
    projects = CLARAProject.objects.filter(Q(user=user) | Q(projectpermissions__user=user))
    project_data = {}
    for project in projects:
        role = 'Owner' if project.user == user else ProjectPermissions.objects.get(user=user, project=project).role
        project_data[project] = {
            'role': role,
            'cost': get_project_api_cost(user=user, project=project),
            'operation_costs': get_project_operation_costs(user=user, project=project),
        }
    return render(request, 'clara_app/project_list.html', {'projects': project_data})
In the updated code, we use the Q object from Django's query API to filter projects where the user is either the project owner (user=user) or has a role in the project (projectpermissions__user=user). We then iterate over the filtered projects and determine the role for each project. If the project owner is the current user, we set the role to "Owner." Otherwise, we retrieve the role from the ProjectPermissions object associated with the user and project.

Next, update the template project_list.html to display the role for each project:

html
Copy code
{% extends "clara_app/base.html" %}

{% block content %}
  <h1>Your Projects</h1>
  <button id="toggleCosts">Show/hide costs</button>
  <ul>
    {% for project, data in projects.items %}
      <li>
        <a href="{% url 'project_detail' project.id %}">{{ project.title }}</a>
        <p>Role: {{ data.role }}</p>
        <div class="costInfo" style="display: none;">
          <p>Total cost: ${{ data.cost|floatformat:2 }}</p>
          <p>Cost per operation:</p>
          <ul>
            {% for operation, cost in data.operation_costs.items %}
              <li>{{ operation }}: ${{ cost|floatformat:2 }}</li>
            {% endfor %}
          </ul>
        </div>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
  <script>
    document.getElementById("toggleCosts").addEventListener("click", function() {
      var costInfos = document.getElementsByClassName("costInfo");
      for (var i = 0; i < costInfos.length; i++) {
        if (costInfos[i].style.display === "none") {
          costInfos[i].style.display = "block";
        } else {
          costInfos[i].style.display = "none";
        }
      }
    });
  </script>
{% endblock %}
In the template, we added a <p> tag to display the role for each project (<p>Role: {{ data.role }}</p>). This will show the role information alongside the project title.

These updates will include projects where the user has a role, display the role for each project, and maintain the existing functionality of displaying costs and operations.

Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance!

User
Hm, I am testing and I get this error when I go into the project_list view:

NameError at /accounts/project_list/
name 'Q' is not defined
Request Method:	GET
Request URL:	http://localhost:8000/accounts/project_list/
Django Version:	4.2.1

Python Executable:	C:\Users\manny\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python3.exe

Line 264 is

   projects = CLARAProject.objects.filter(Q(user=user) | Q(projectpermissions__user=user))
ChatGPT
I apologize for the oversight. The Q object needs to be imported from django.db.models in order to use it for complex queries. To resolve the NameError in your code, add the import statement at the top of your views.py file:

python
Copy code
from django.db.models import Q
Make sure this line is placed alongside other import statements at the top of the file. Once you add the import, the Q object should be recognized and the error should be resolved.

Let me know if you encounter any further issues or have additional questions!

User
Great! I have been testing, this all works as intended.

We are breaking for lunch now, will be back a bit later to continue with the next steps :)

Sounds good! Enjoy your lunch break, and take your time. I'll be here when you're ready to continue. Just reach out whenever you're back, and we'll pick up where we left off. Have a great lunch!

User
We had lunch and then did some shopping, now back!

I think the next step is to modify the various project-related views and use the role information to restrict the operations that can be performed. We could start with create_plain_text, where the views code and template are as follows:

# Create or edit "plain" version of the text    
@login_required
@user_has_a_project_role
def create_plain_text(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    clara_project_internal = CLARAProjectInternal(project.internal_id, project.l2, project.l1)
    success = False
    api_error = None

    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = CreatePlainTextForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            existing_plain_text = clara_project_internal.text_versions["plain"]
            if form.cleaned_data['text_choice'] == 'manual':
                # User provided their own text
                clara_project_internal.save_text_version("plain", form.cleaned_data['text'])
            else:
                try:
                    api_calls = clara_project_internal.create_plain_text(form.cleaned_data['prompt'])
                    print(f'--- Created plain text: {len(api_calls)} API calls')
                    store_api_calls(api_calls, project, request.user, "plain")
                    plain_text = clara_project_internal.load_text_version("plain")
                    form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text': plain_text, 'text_choice': 'manual'})
                    success = True
                    # Delete other text versions if they exist (this will in particular be the case in a cloned project)
                    clara_project_internal.delete_text_versions([ "summary", "cefr_level", "segmented", "gloss", "lemma" ])
                except Exception as e:
                    api_error = f"An error occurred while generating the text. Please try again in a few minutes. Error details: {str(e)}"
                    form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text_choice': 'generate'})
            if not api_error:
                CLARAProjectAction.objects.create(
                    project=project,
                    action='edit' if existing_plain_text else 'create',
                    text_version='plain',
                    user=request.user
                )
    else:
        try:
            # Try to load the existing plain text, if it exists
            plain_text = clara_project_internal.load_text_version("plain")
            form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text': plain_text, 'text_choice': 'manual'})
        except FileNotFoundError:
            # If no plain text exists yet, initialize an empty form
            form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text_choice': 'generate'})

    return render(request, 'clara_app/create_plain_text.html', {'form': form, 'project': project, 'success': success, 'api_error': api_error})

{% extends 'clara_app/base.html' %}

{% block title %}Create Plain Text{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
  {% if api_error %}
    <p class="error-message">{{ api_error }}</p>
  {% endif %}
  {% if success %}
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        Plain text created successfully.
    </div>
  {% endif %}
  <h2>Create Plain Text</h2>
  <form method="post" id="create-plain-text-form">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form.as_p }}
    <button type="submit" id="submit-button">Create</button>
  </form>
  <a href="{% url 'project_detail' project.id %}">Back to Project</a>

  <script type="text/javascript">
    document.getElementById('create-plain-text-form').onsubmit = function() {
      document.getElementById('submit-button').textContent = "Processing...";
    };
  </script>
{% endblock %}

Here, I think we want to restrict things as follows, depending on the user's role:

OWNER can do everything
ANNOTATOR can invoke manual editing but not AI-based generation
VIEWER can't invoke any operation, they can only look at existing text if it is there

Does this seem right to you?
ChatGPT
Yes, your approach to restrict the operations based on the user's role is correct. Here's how you can modify the create_plain_text view to enforce these permissions:

python
Copy code
@login_required
@user_has_a_project_role
def create_plain_text(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    clara_project_internal = CLARAProjectInternal(project.internal_id, project.l2, project.l1)
    success = False
    api_error = None

    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = CreatePlainTextForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            existing_plain_text = clara_project_internal.text_versions["plain"]
            if form.cleaned_data['text_choice'] == 'manual':
                # User provided their own text
                if user_has_a_named_project_role(request.user, project_id, ['OWNER', 'ANNOTATOR']):
                    clara_project_internal.save_text_version("plain", form.cleaned_data['text'])
                else:
                    raise PermissionDenied("You don't have permission to save manual text.")
            else:
                if user_has_a_named_project_role(request.user, project_id, ['OWNER', 'ANNOTATOR']):
                    try:
                        api_calls = clara_project_internal.create_plain_text(form.cleaned_data['prompt'])
                        print(f'--- Created plain text: {len(api_calls)} API calls')
                        store_api_calls(api_calls, project, request.user, "plain")
                        plain_text = clara_project_internal.load_text_version("plain")
                        form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text': plain_text, 'text_choice': 'manual'})
                        success = True
                        # Delete other text versions if they exist (this will in particular be the case in a cloned project)
                        clara_project_internal.delete_text_versions(["summary", "cefr_level", "segmented", "gloss", "lemma"])
                    except Exception as e:
                        api_error = f"An error occurred while generating the text. Please try again in a few minutes. Error details: {str(e)}"
                        form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text_choice': 'generate'})
                else:
                    raise PermissionDenied("You don't have permission to generate plain text.")
            
            if not api_error:
                CLARAProjectAction.objects.create(
                    project=project,
                    action='edit' if existing_plain_text else 'create',
                    text_version='plain',
                    user=request.user
                )
    else:
        try:
            # Try to load the existing plain text, if it exists
            plain_text = clara_project_internal.load_text_version("plain")
            form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text': plain_text, 'text_choice': 'manual'})
        except FileNotFoundError:
            # If no plain text exists yet, initialize an empty form
            form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text_choice': 'generate'})

    return render(request, 'clara_app/create_plain_text.html', {'form': form, 'project': project, 'success': success, 'api_error': api_error})
With these modifications, the owner can perform all operations, the annotator can only save manual text but not generate it, and the viewer doesn't have permission to perform any operations.

Please make sure to import the PermissionDenied exception at the top of your views.py file:

python
Copy code
from django.core.exceptions import PermissionDenied

This looks good, except that here I think we need to restrict access to just OWNER?

I apologize for the confusion. If you want to restrict the access to generating text to only the project owner, you can modify the code as follows:

python
Copy code
else:
    if user_has_a_named_project_role(request.user, project_id, ['OWNER']):
        try:
            api_calls = clara_project_internal.create_plain_text(form.cleaned_data['prompt'])
            print(f'--- Created plain text: {len(api_calls)} API calls')
            store_api_calls(api_calls, project, request.user, "plain")
            plain_text = clara_project_internal.load_text_version("plain")
            form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text': plain_text, 'text_choice': 'manual'})
            success = True
            # Delete other text versions if they exist (this will in particular be the case in a cloned project)
            clara_project_internal.delete_text_versions(["summary", "cefr_level", "segmented", "gloss", "lemma"])
        except Exception as e:
            api_error = f"An error occurred while generating the text. Please try again in a few minutes. Error details: {str(e)}"
            form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text_choice': 'generate'})
    else:
        raise PermissionDenied("You don't have permission to generate text by calling the AI.")
This change ensures that only the project owner can generate text by calling the AI, and other roles will receive a PermissionDenied exception.

Once again, please ensure that you have imported the PermissionDenied exception from django.core.exceptions at the top of your views.py file.

Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!

                    text_version='plain',
                    user=request.user
                )
    else:
        try:
            # Try to load the existing plain text, if it exists
            plain_text = clara_project_internal.load_text_version("plain")
            form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text': plain_text, 'text_choice': 'manual'})
        except FileNotFoundError:
            # If no plain text exists yet, initialize an empty form
            form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text_choice': 'generate'})

    return render(request, 'clara_app/create_plain_text.html', {'form': form, 'project': project, 'success': success, 'api_error': api_error})

One thing I don't fully understand though: when I try to carry out a view operation in a situation where I don't have the right permission, and get an exception like

raise PermissionDenied("You don't have permission to generate text by calling the AI.")

I just see a 403 error. Is that correct? I was expecting to see the message as well.
ChatGPT
I'm glad the code modifications are working well for you!

Regarding the exception message not being displayed, by default, Django's built-in exception handling middleware converts the PermissionDenied exception to a 403 Forbidden response without displaying the exception message. This behavior is intentional for security reasons, as it helps prevent exposing potentially sensitive information to unauthorized users.

If you'd like to display a custom message to the user when they encounter a PermissionDenied exception, you can customize the error handling by creating your own custom exception handler.

Here's an example of how you can create a custom exception handler to display the exception message:

In your Django project directory, create a file called handlers.py.

Add the following code to the handlers.py file:

python
Copy code
from django.core.exceptions import PermissionDenied
from django.http import HttpResponseForbidden
from django.shortcuts import render


def custom_permission_denied_handler(request, exception):
    if isinstance(exception, PermissionDenied):
        return render(request, 'clara_app/403.html', {'message': str(exception)}, status=403)
    return HttpResponseForbidden()
In your Django project's settings.py file, add or modify the handler403 setting to point to the custom handler:
python
Copy code
handler403 = 'your_project.handlers.custom_permission_denied_handler'
Create a template file called 403.html in your app's template directory (clara_app/templates/clara_app/) with the following content:
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>403 Forbidden</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>403 Forbidden</h1>
    <p>{{ message }}</p>
</body>
</html>
Restart your Django development server.
Now, when a PermissionDenied exception is raised, the custom exception handler will render the 403.html template and display the exception message.

Please note that custom exception handling is not recommended in production environments, as it can potentially leak sensitive information. It's primarily useful for development and debugging purposes.

Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance!

Thank you! But if you recommend not doing this in a production environment, then I'll pass. We will hopefully be deploying an initial version of C-LARA soon.

Now that we have the roles working, I was thinking the next step would be to add basic support for evaluating annotation accuracy. As previously discussed, this would work by diffing the internalised forms of the AI-generated and corrected versions of different kinds of annotated text.

It is probably helpful even at this stage to add a control in each annotation view which lets the annotator indicate after editing a version of the text that the edited version can meaningfully be treated as gold standard material. The annotation evaluation view can show results only for the versions of the text where gold standard material is available.

What are your thoughts here?
ChatGPT
Adding support for evaluating annotation accuracy sounds like a valuable addition to your project. It's a good idea to provide a control for annotators to indicate when their edited version can be treated as gold standard material. This will help in filtering and displaying the relevant versions during the annotation evaluation process.

Here's a suggestion on how you can approach this:

Add a boolean field named is_gold_standard to the CLARAProjectInternal model to track whether a specific version of the text is considered gold standard material. Set the default value to False.

Modify each annotation view to include a checkbox or toggle button that allows annotators to indicate whether their edited version should be treated as gold standard material. The value of this control should be stored in the is_gold_standard field.

In the annotation evaluation view, retrieve and display the versions of the text where is_gold_standard is set to True. These will be the versions used for evaluating annotation accuracy.

You can calculate the annotation accuracy by comparing the AI-generated version with the gold standard version for each annotation type (e.g., POS tags, dependencies, named entities, etc.). Depending on your evaluation criteria, you can measure metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, or any other relevant measure.

By adding this functionality, you'll be able to track and evaluate the accuracy of annotations by comparing the AI-generated and corrected versions of different types of annotated text.

Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional guidance!

After discussing with C-LARA colleagues and doing a couple of experiments, some more thoughts:

1. Our Dutch colleague Catia has been looking at a sample Dutch story glossed in English, Arabic and Turkish. It turns out that there are quite a lot of errors. But it occurred to me that I could ask ChatGPT-4/you to look at the glossed text and revise it. This clearly improves things in the EN-glossed version. I don't know Arabic, so can't tell what's happening these yet, but I see changes.

2. This suggests that a useful addition to all the annotation views would be another option parallel to 'Generate using AI' and 'Manually edit', namely 'Revise using AI'. This would be easy to add, adapting the 'Generate using AI' code.

3. We could generalise the 'gold standard' idea above. As well as marking whether a text version is 'gold standard', we should mark its provenance as one of 'AI generated', 'AI edited' or 'Human edited' and also its revision sequence number. These could be kept in a revision history which is part of the CLARAProjectInternal  object, linking different versions of the files to associated metadata.

4. In the evaluation screen, we would have options to compare the different versions of a file, choosing them off a menu derived from the revision history, with the default being to compare first and last. The comparison would by default produce just an error rate, but could optionally also generate a detailed diff.

What do you think?
ChatGPT
Thank you for sharing the updates and additional thoughts. Here are my comments on each point:

Using ChatGPT-4 (me) to revise the glossed text sounds like a promising approach to improve the quality of the generated versions. It can be particularly helpful in languages where you have limited proficiency. You can leverage the AI's capabilities to refine and enhance the glossed text in different languages.

Adding an option to "Revise using AI" alongside "Generate using AI" and "Manually edit" is a good idea. It allows users to leverage AI assistance not only in generating initial versions but also in revising and refining the text. Adapting the existing code for generating text using AI should be relatively straightforward.

Generalizing the concept of the "gold standard" and introducing provenance and revision history metadata is a valuable addition. By keeping track of the source (AI-generated, AI-edited, or Human-edited) and the revision sequence number, you can establish a comprehensive history of the text versions and their associated metadata. This revision history can help in tracking the evolution of the text and understanding the provenance of each version.

In the evaluation screen, providing options to compare different versions of a file based on the revision history is an excellent approach. Allowing users to select and compare specific versions, with the option to choose the default comparison as the first and last versions, gives them flexibility in evaluating the changes and assessing the annotation accuracy. Generating an error rate by default and optionally providing a detailed diff can provide valuable insights into the quality and changes between the versions.

Overall, these additions and enhancements align well with the goals of your project and can significantly improve the annotation workflow, accuracy evaluation, and overall user experience. Let me know if you have any further questions or need more guidance!

User
Sounds like we're on the same page here. I am particularly curious to see how effectively you can revise the annotations - it would be very interesting to do this systematically with many texts and languages. We would also be able to track your annotation performance over time. My expectation is that it would improve with upgrades to new versions of your model.

I will start by looking at the 'revision history' idea, will soon be back with more questions about that!
ChatGPT
That sounds like an intriguing and exciting direction to explore! I'm eager to assist you in implementing the revision history feature and evaluating its effectiveness. Tracking the evolution of the annotations and observing the improvements in AI-generated revisions can provide valuable insights into the model's performance and progress over time.

Feel free to return with any questions you have regarding the revision history or any other aspect of your project. I'm here to help!

Okay, so I think the first step is to extend this CLARAProjectInternal method:

# Save one of the text files associated with the object and if necessary archive the old one
    def save_text_version(self, version: str, text: str) -> None:
        file_path = self._file_path_for_version(version)
        
        # Archive the old version, if it exists
        if file_path.exists():
            timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')
            archive_dir = self.project_dir / 'archive'
            archive_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
            archive_path = archive_dir / f'{version}_{timestamp}.txt'
            file_path.rename(archive_path)

        # Save the new version
        text = make_line_breaks_canonical_n(text)
        file_path.write_text(text, encoding="utf-8")
        self.text_versions[version] = str(file_path)

We could perhaps do the following:

1. Add some keyword arguments to pass metadata, e.g. 'source' (would be one of {'ai_generated', 'ai_revised', 'human_revised'}), 'user' (the user who made the update - could be the project owner or an annotator), 'timestamp'.

2. Add code in save_text_version to update a metadata file, which would index the different versions and associate them with metadata. For downward compatibility, it could reconstruct metadata for existing cases where it is not yet available - it would be reasonable to infer that the first version was AI-generated and all the others were human-revised.

3. Add a method to get the metadata file for a project and version (version is one of "plain", "summary", "cefr_level", "segmented", "gloss", "lemma").

How does this sound to you?
ChatGPT
The proposed approach for extending the CLARAProjectInternal class and adding a metadata file to track the revision history sounds reasonable. Here's an outline of the steps involved:

Modify the save_text_version method to include additional keyword arguments for metadata such as source, user, and timestamp. You can pass these arguments when calling the method.

Create a metadata file (e.g., JSON or CSV) that will store the revision history for each text version. The file can have entries with fields like version, source, user, and timestamp.

In the save_text_version method, after saving the new text version, update the metadata file with the corresponding entry for the version. If the metadata file doesn't exist, create it and initialize it with the first entry (assumed to be AI-generated).

Implement a method to retrieve the metadata for a specific project and version. This method can read the metadata file, locate the entry for the requested version, and return the associated metadata.

By maintaining this revision history metadata file, you'll have a record of the different versions of each text and the relevant information like their sources, users who made the updates, and timestamps. It will enable you to track the provenance of each version and support further analysis and evaluation.

Let me know if you need further clarification or assistance with the implementation!

I have started making the changes to the methods of CLARAProjectInternal in clara_main.py. Here is the relevant part:

    # Save one of the text files associated with the object.
    # If necessary archive the old one.
    # Update the metadata file, first creating it if it doesn't exist.

            archive_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
            archive_path = archive_dir / f'{version}_{timestamp}.txt'

        to_do()

How does this look to you?



ChatGPT
The changes you've made to the CLARAProjectInternal class and the addition of the metadata functionality look good so far. It seems like you're on the right track.

In the _create_metadata_file_if_missing method, you can iterate through the versions ("plain", "summary", "cefr_level", etc.) and check if the file exists for each version. If it does, you can create a metadata entry with the appropriate information (e.g., source, user, timestamp) based on your assumptions. You can also set the gold_standard flag to False by default.

In the _update_metadata_file method, you can read the existing metadata file, transfer the entry for the file_path to the archive_path, and create a new entry for the file_path with the updated information (version, source, user, gold_standard, etc.). Finally, you can write the updated metadata back to the file.

Overall, the structure and approach you've taken seem reasonable. Once you implement the missing parts (_create_metadata_file_if_missing and _update_metadata_file), you should have a functional metadata system in place. Let me know if you need any further assistance with the implementation.

User
Great! Would you be able to write initial versions of _create_metadata_file_if_missing and _update_metadata_file?
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here are the initial versions of the _create_metadata_file_if_missing and _update_metadata_file methods:

python
Copy code
import json

def _create_metadata_file_if_missing(self, user):
    metadata_file = self._get_metadata_file()
    metadata = self.get_metadata()

    versions = ["plain", "summary", "cefr_level", "segmented", "gloss", "lemma"]

    # Check if any metadata entries are missing for the existing files
    for version in versions:
        file_path = self._file_path_for_version(version)
        if file_path.exists():
            # Check if metadata entry exists for the file
            if not any(entry['file'] == str(file_path) for entry in metadata):
                # Assume the earliest file is source=ai_generated and the rest are source=human_revised
                source = "ai_generated" if version == versions[0] else "human_revised"
                entry = {
                    "file": str(file_path),
                    "version": version,
                    "source": source,
                    "user": user,
                    "timestamp": file_path.stat().st_mtime,  # Use file modification timestamp as the timestamp
                    "gold_standard": False
                }
                metadata.append(entry)

    # Write the updated metadata to the file
    with open(metadata_file, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(metadata, f)

def _update_metadata_file(self, file_path, archive_path, version, source, user, gold_standard):
    metadata_file = self._get_metadata_file()
    metadata = self.get_metadata()

    # Find the entry for the file_path and update it
    for entry in metadata:
        if entry['file'] == str(file_path):
            entry['file'] = str(archive_path)  # Transfer the entry to the archive path
            break

    # Create a new entry for the file_path with the updated information
    new_entry = {
        "file": str(file_path),
        "version": version,
        "source": source,
        "user": user,
        "timestamp": file_path.stat().st_mtime,  # Use file modification timestamp as the timestamp
        "gold_standard": gold_standard
    }
    metadata.append(new_entry)

    # Write the updated metadata to the file
    with open(metadata_file, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(metadata, f)
These methods should allow you to create and update the metadata file for the project. Remember to update the class definition to include self as the first parameter for these methods. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!

User
Thank you! The second one, _update_metadata_file, looks good, but I don't think _create_metadata_file_if_missing is correct yet. It's also necessary to look inside the archive dir, found by self._get_archive_dir(), where the files will have names of the form

archive_dir / f'{version}_{timestamp}.txt'

and create metadata entries for all of them. Note that it's necessary at some stage to combine the files from the archive dir and the files found by doing

self._file_path_for_version(version)

since all the files for a given value of 'version' need to be ordered chronologically, with the first one marked as source='ai_generated' and the others as source='human_revised'.

Does this make sense?
ChatGPT
Apologies for the oversight. I have updated the _create_metadata_file_if_missing method to include processing the files inside the archive directory. Please find the revised code below:

python
Copy code
import json
import os

def _create_metadata_file_if_missing(self, user):

    # Check if any metadata entries are missing for the existing files
    for version in versions:
        file_path = self._file_path_for_version(version)
        if file_path.exists():
            # Check if metadata entry exists for the file
            if not any(entry['file'] == str(file_path) for entry in metadata):
                # Assume the earliest file is source=ai_generated and the rest are source=human_revised
                source = "ai_generated" if version == versions[0] else "human_revised"
                entry = {

                    "user": user,
                    "timestamp": file_path.stat().st_mtime,  # Use file modification timestamp as the timestamp
                    "gold_standard": False
                }
                metadata.append(entry)

    # Process the files in the archive directory
    archive_dir = self._get_archive_dir()
    if archive_dir.exists():
        for filename in os.listdir(archive_dir):
            file_path = archive_dir / filename
            if not any(entry['file'] == str(file_path) for entry in metadata):
                # Extract version and timestamp from the filename
                version, timestamp = filename.split("_", 1)
                source = "human_revised"
                entry = {
                    "file": str(file_path),
                    "version": version,

                    "user": user,
                    "timestamp": float(timestamp[:-4]),  # Remove the file extension and convert to float
                    "gold_standard": False
                }
                metadata.append(entry)

    # Sort the metadata entries by timestamp
    metadata.sort(key=lambda entry: entry['timestamp'])

    # Assign source=ai_generated to the earliest file for each version
    versions_processed = set()
    for entry in metadata:
        version = entry['version']
        if version not in versions_processed:
            entry['source'] = 'ai_generated'
            versions_processed.add(version)

    # Write the updated metadata to the file
    with open(metadata_file, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(metadata, f)
I apologize for any confusion caused. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!

User
Thank you! This looks very good, except for the timestamps, which are currently appearing in three places. When creating pathnames for the archive dir, it's done like this:

timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')

When creating the metadata entry for a 'version' file, it's done like this:

"timestamp": file_path.stat().st_mtime,

and when creating one for an archive file, like this:

version,  timestamp = filename.split("_", 1)
"timestamp": float(timestamp[:-4]),

Can we make these consistent?
ChatGPT
Apologies for the inconsistency. We can make the timestamps consistent by using the same format across all instances. Let's update the code to use the same timestamp format for all cases. Here's the revised code:

python
Copy code
import json
import os
from datetime import datetime

def _create_metadata_file_if_missing(self, user):
    metadata_file = self._get_metadata_file()
    metadata = self.get_metadata()

    versions = ["plain", "summary", "cefr_level", "segmented", "gloss", "lemma"]

    # Check if any metadata entries are missing for the existing files
    for version in versions:
        file_path = self._file_path_for_version(version)
        if file_path.exists():
            # Check if metadata entry exists for the file
            if not any(entry['file'] == str(file_path) for entry in metadata):
                # Assume the earliest file is source=ai_generated and the rest are source=human_revised
                source = "ai_generated" if version == versions[0] else "human_revised"
                entry = {
                    "file": str(file_path),

I've replaced the usage of datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S') with datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S') to maintain consistency throughout the code.

User
Wait a minute, this is still not quite right. For the version file, you previously had

"timestamp": file_path.stat().st_mtime,  # Use file modification timestamp as the timestamp

which gets the information from the right place, i.e. the file modification timestamp. In the new version, you have

"timestamp": datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S'),

which is the format we want. But we need to combine these, so that we have the version modification timestamp in the '%Y%m%d%H%M%S' format?
ChatGPT
Apologies for the oversight. You're correct, we need to combine the existing file modification timestamp with the desired format. Here's the updated code to accomplish that:

python
Copy code
import json
import os
from datetime import datetime

def _create_metadata_file_if_missing(self, user):
    metadata_file = self._get_metadata_file()
    metadata = self.get_metadata()

    versions = ["plain", "summary", "cefr_level", "segmented", "gloss", "lemma"]

    # Check if any metadata entries are missing for the existing files
    for version in versions:
        file_path = self._file_path_for_version(version)
        if file_path.exists():
            # Check if metadata entry exists for the file
            if not any(entry['file'] == str(file_path) for entry in metadata):
                # Assume the earliest file is source=ai_generated and the rest are source=human_revised
                source = "ai_generated" if version == versions[0] else "human_revised"
                entry = {
                    "file": str(file_path),
                    "version": version,
                    "source": source,
                    "user": user,
                    "timestamp": datetime.fromtimestamp(file_path.stat().st_mtime).strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S'),
                    "gold_standard": False
                }
                metadata.append(entry)

    # Process the files in the archive directory
    archive_dir = self._get_archive_dir()
    if archive_dir.exists():
        for filename in os.listdir(archive_dir):
            file_path = archive_dir / filename
            if not any(entry['file'] == str(file_path) for entry in metadata):
                # Extract version and timestamp from the filename
                version, timestamp = filename.split("_", 1)
                source = "human_revised"
                entry = {
                    "file": str(file_path),
                    "version": version,
                    "source": source,
                    "user": user,
                    "timestamp": timestamp[:-4],
                    "gold_standard": False
                }
                metadata.append(entry)

    # Sort the metadata entries by timestamp
    metadata.sort(key=lambda entry: entry['timestamp'])

    # Assign source=ai_generated to the earliest file for each version
    versions_processed = set()
    for entry in metadata:
        version = entry['version']
        if version not in versions_processed:
            entry['source'] = 'ai_generated'
            versions_processed.add(version)

    # Write the updated metadata to the file
    with open(metadata_file, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(metadata, f)
Now the file modification timestamp is properly combined with the desired format %Y%m%d%H%M%S in the metadata entry.

User
I am testing it, and I get this error:

  File "C:\cygwin64\home\sf\c-lara-svn\clara_app\clara_core\clara_main.py", line 283, in _create_metadata_file_if_missing
    "timestamp": datetime.fromtimestamp(file_path.stat().st_mtime).strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S'),
AttributeError: module 'datetime' has no attribute 'fromtimestamp'
ChatGPT
Apologies for the confusion. It seems there was a mistake in my response. The correct way to access the fromtimestamp function is by importing it from the datetime module directly. Please modify the line:

python
Copy code
"timestamp": datetime.fromtimestamp(file_path.stat().st_mtime).strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S'),
to:

python
Copy code
from datetime import datetime
# ...
"timestamp": datetime.fromtimestamp(os.path.getmtime(str(file_path))).strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S'),
This should resolve the attribute error and properly retrieve the file modification timestamp for the metadata entry.

User
Thank you, that does indeed resolve the error! Now when I invoke the _create_metadata_file_if_missing I do indeed get a metadata file created.

Small suggestion: here,

# Write the updated metadata to the file
        with open(metadata_file, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(metadata, f)

can we prettyprint the file?
ChatGPT
Certainly! To pretty-print the JSON file, you can modify the line where the metadata is written to the file. You can use the indent parameter of the json.dump() function to specify the indentation level for pretty-printing. Here's an updated version of the code:

python
Copy code
# Write the updated metadata to the file with pretty-printing
import json
with open(metadata_file, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(metadata, f, indent=4)
By setting indent=4, the JSON file will be indented with 4 spaces for improved readability. Feel free to adjust the indentation level as desired.

User
I made some small fixes, and now everything is working! The metadata file is updated as expected with both AI generation and manual editing.

Next, we want to adjust the relevant views so that we can mark when edited texts are to be considered as 'gold standard'. I'm thinking a simple way to do this would be to add a checkbox under the editing window. For example, here's the views code, form and template for the segmentation view:

# Create or edit "segmented" version of the text     
@login_required
@user_has_a_project_role
def create_segmented_text(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    clara_project_internal = CLARAProjectInternal(project.internal_id, project.l2, project.l1)
    success = False
    api_error = None

                clara_project_internal.save_text_version("segmented", form.cleaned_data['text'], user=request.user.username)
            else:

                    form = CreateSegmentedTextForm(initial={'text_choice': 'generate'})
            if not api_error:
                CLARAProjectAction.objects.create(
                    project=project,
                    action='edit' if existing_segmented_text else 'create',
                    text_version='segmented',
                    user=request.user
                )
    else:
        try:
            segmented_text = clara_project_internal.load_text_version("segmented")
            text_choice = 'manual'

    return render(request, 'clara_app/create_segmented_text.html', {'form': form, 'project': project, 'success': success, 'api_error': api_error})

class CreateSegmentedTextForm(forms.Form):
    text_choice = forms.ChoiceField(
        choices=[('generate', 'Generate segmented text using AI'), ('manual', 'Manually enter segmented text')],
        widget=forms.RadioSelect,
        initial='generate'
    )

What do you think?
ChatGPT
Adding a checkbox to mark edited texts as 'gold standard' is a good approach. It provides a simple and intuitive way for annotators to indicate when they consider their edited versions as reliable references.

To implement this, you can modify the CreateSegmentedTextForm by adding a gold_standard checkbox field. Here's an updated version of the form:

python
Copy code
class CreateSegmentedTextForm(forms.Form):
    text_choice = forms.ChoiceField(
        choices=[('generate', 'Generate segmented text using AI'), ('manual', 'Manually enter segmented text')],
        widget=forms.RadioSelect,
        initial='generate'
    )
    text = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea, required=False)
    gold_standard = forms.BooleanField(required=False)
In the view code, you can access the value of the gold_standard checkbox field from the form's cleaned data. When saving the text version, you can pass the gold_standard value to the save_text_version method. Here's an updated version of the view code:

python
Copy code
if form.cleaned_data['text_choice'] == 'manual':
    if not user_has_a_named_project_role(request.user, project_id, ['OWNER', 'ANNOTATOR']):
        raise PermissionDenied("You don't have permission to save edited text.")
    clara_project_internal.save_text_version("segmented", form.cleaned_data['text'], user=request.user.username, gold_standard=form.cleaned_data['gold_standard'])
With these changes, the annotators will have the option to mark their edited versions as 'gold standard' by checking the corresponding checkbox.

User
Thank you! So nice and simple, and it worked first time. I will do the same in the other relevant views.
ChatGPT
You're welcome! I'm glad it worked well for you. Applying the same approach to other relevant views is a good plan. By adding the 'gold standard' checkbox to those views, annotators will have the flexibility to indicate the reliability of their edited versions across different types of annotations. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.

User
I'll be back shortly when I've added the 'gold standard' checkboxes, and then I hope we can discuss how to use the metadata to create a view where users can compare two different versions of a text.
ChatGPT
Sounds good! Take your time to add the 'gold standard' checkboxes to the relevant views. Once you're done, we can discuss how to leverage the metadata to create a view for comparing different versions of a text. I'll be here when you're ready to continue.

User
Okay, that all seems to be working fine. I added the 'gold standard' checkboxes to the other views and tested on a Swedish story. Everything behaved as expected.

Now, for the 'text comparison' view, my initial thought was that the user would start by selecting which type of annotation they wanted to perform the comparison on, out of ( "plain", "summary", "segmented", "gloss", "lemma" ). They would then get two menus derived from the metadata, where they chose the two versions to compare. The default for the first version would be the initial AI-generated version, and the default for the second version would be the most recent version.

They would also check boxes for the type of feedback they wanted. Possible choices would include "Error rate" and "Detailed". In both cases, the code would internalise both versions of the text in the appropriate way and diff them using difflib. For "Error rate", you would just calculate insertions, deletions and substitutions and present a number. For "Detailed", the whole annotated text could be presented, with the differences highlighted appropriately.

What do you think?
ChatGPT
Your idea for the "text comparison" view sounds great! It provides flexibility for users to select the annotation type they want to compare and choose the specific versions they want to compare. The option to select the type of feedback, such as "Error rate" and "Detailed", adds further customization.

Using difflib to calculate the differences between the versions and presenting them in a clear and highlighted manner is a good approach. It allows users to quickly understand the changes and assess the accuracy of the annotations.

I think this approach will provide a valuable tool for users to evaluate and compare different versions of annotated texts. Are there any specific questions or concerns you have about implementing this feature?

User
Glad to hear you approve!

Well, why don't we start with the code which does the comparison? I think this will be a method of CLARAProjectInternal which takes four inputs: the two files, the type of annotation out of ( "plain", "summary", "segmented", "gloss", "lemma" ), and the types of response required, out of at least ( "error_rate" and "detailed").

The processing will be something like this:

1. Read and internalise the two texts using the function clara_internalise.internalize_text(input_text, l2_language, l1_language, text_type). This gives us two Text objects as defined by clara_classes:

"""
This module defines the following classes to represent a text and its components:

1. ContentElement: Represents a single content element, such as a word or a punctuation mark.
2. Segment: Represents a segment of text, containing a list of ContentElements.
3. Page: Represents a page of text, containing a list of Segments.
4. Text: Represents a full text, containing a list of Pages and metadata about the text, such as L1 and L2 languages.

Each class also includes methods to convert the objects to and from JSON and plain text formats.

It also defines the class APICall, which represents an API call to gpt-4.

3. Convert the diff Text object into the outputs. To get 'error_rate', we just do a simple calculation. To get 'detailed', we do some formatting, probably using the to_text method of the Text object. But we need to figure out how to highlight the changed parts.

How does this sound to you?

The approach you described for performing the text comparison looks good. Let's go through the steps you outlined:

Read and internalize the two texts using the clara_internalise.internalize_text(input_text, l2_language, l1_language, text_type) function, which gives us two Text objects. This step ensures that the texts are properly structured and ready for comparison.

Perform an operation to generate a diff Text object that represents the differences between the two input texts. This diff object should mark the content elements as insertions, deletions, substitutions, or plain elements. You can define a method within the CLARAProjectInternal class to handle this comparison operation.

Convert the diff Text object into the desired outputs. For the "error_rate" feedback, calculate the number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions and present it as a simple error rate. For the "detailed" feedback, format the diff Text object using its to_text method. To highlight the changed parts, you can consider using HTML or CSS styling to apply different styles (e.g., color, background) to the modified elements.

Overall, your approach seems reasonable and provides the necessary flexibility to generate different types of feedback. You can start implementing each step and refine it as you go along. If you have any specific questions or need assistance with any particular part, feel free to ask!

User
Okay, let me start by implementing (1) as a method in CLARAProjectInternal. So that this file doesn't get too big, I'm thinking that (2) and (3) should perhaps be functions in a new file called something like clara_diff.py. I will appreciate your assistance on this part.

Does that sound okay as a plan?
ChatGPT
Yes, that sounds like a good plan. Implementing (1) as a method in CLARAProjectInternal and separating (2) and (3) into functions in a separate file called clara_diff.py will help keep the code organized and modular.

You can start by implementing the method for (1) in CLARAProjectInternal and then we can proceed with creating the clara_diff.py file and implementing the diff operation and conversion methods there.

Feel free to share the code for the method in CLARAProjectInternal once you've implemented it, and we can continue from there.

User
Great! I will implement the CLARAProjectInternal method for (1) and show that to you when I have it. More shortly.
ChatGPT
Sounds good! Take your time to implement the method in CLARAProjectInternal for (1). Once you have it, feel free to share the code, and we can continue from there. If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to ask.

Okay, the first part seems quite straightforward. Here's the new method for CLARAProjectInternal :

    # Diff two versions of the same kind of file and return information as specified
    def diff_editions_of_text_version(self, file_path1: str, file_path2: str, version: str, required: List[str]) -> Dict[str, str]:
        text1 = Path(file_path1).read_text(encoding="utf-8")
        text1 = make_line_breaks_canonical_n(text1)
        internalised_text1 = internalize_text(text1, self.l2_language, self.l1_language, version)
        
        text2 = Path(file_path2).read_text(encoding="utf-8")
        text2 = make_line_breaks_canonical_n(text2)
        internalised_text2 = internalize_text(text2, self.l2_language, self.l1_language, version)

        return diff_text_objects(internalised_text1, internalised_text2, version, required)

and here is the skeleton for the new file clara_diff.py:

"""Diff two Text objects of the same type and return information as required.

Main function: diff_text_objects(internalised_text1, internalised_text2, version, required)

- internalised_text1 and internalised_text2 are Text objects
- version is one of ( "plain", "summary", "segmented", "gloss", "lemma" )
- required is a list specifying the types of information to return.
  Currently supported options are { 'error_rate', 'details' }.
  'error_rate' gives a simple error rate.
  'details' gives a string with a formatted version of the text showing highlighted differences.

Returns a dict indexed by the elements of "required"
"""

def diff_text_objects(internalised_text1, internalised_text2, version, required):
    internalised_diff = text_objects_to_diff(internalised_text1, internalised_text2, version)
    response = {}
    if 'error_rate' in required:
        response['error_rate'] = internalised_diff_to_error_rate(internalised_diff)
    if 'details' in required:
        response['details'] = internalised_diff_to_details(internalised_diff)
    return response

# Convert two Text objects to a third Text object which represents their diff
def text_objects_to_diff(internalised_text1, internalised_text2, version):
    return to_do()

# Convert the diff Text object to an error rate
def internalised_diff_to_error_rate(internalised_diff):
    return to_do()

# Convert the diff Text object to a formatted string which highlights the differences
def internalised_diff_to_details(internalised_diff):
    return to_do()

How does this look to you?
ChatGPT
The CLARAProjectInternal method and the skeleton for clara_diff.py look good! You've set up a solid foundation for implementing the diffing functionality. Now we can focus on completing the functions in clara_diff.py to generate the diff Text object, calculate the error rate, and produce a formatted string with highlighted differences.

Let's start with the text_objects_to_diff function in clara_diff.py. This function should take two Text objects, internalised_text1 and internalised_text2, representing different versions of the same file, and return a diff Text object that represents the differences between them. To achieve this, we'll need to compare the content elements in each page, segment, and content element and mark the differences appropriately.

Here's an updated version of clara_diff.py with the implementation for text_objects_to_diff:

python
Copy code
from clara_classes import Text, Page, Segment, ContentElement

def text_objects_to_diff(internalised_text1, internalised_text2, version):
    diff_pages = []
    for page1, page2 in zip(internalised_text1.pages, internalised_text2.pages):
        diff_segments = []
        for segment1, segment2 in zip(page1.segments, page2.segments):
            diff_content_elements = []
            for element1, element2 in zip(segment1.content_elements, segment2.content_elements):
                if element1.content != element2.content:
                    diff_content_element = ContentElement("Diff", element2.content, annotations={"Diff": element2.content})
                else:
                    diff_content_element = element1
                diff_content_elements.append(diff_content_element)
            diff_segment = Segment(diff_content_elements)
            diff_segments.append(diff_segment)
        diff_page = Page(diff_segments)
        diff_pages.append(diff_page)
    return Text(diff_pages, internalised_text1.l2_language, internalised_text1.l1_language)
This implementation iterates over the pages, segments, and content elements of the two input Text objects. For each corresponding element, if the content is different, a new ContentElement with type "Diff" and the updated content is created. Otherwise, the original content element from internalised_text1 is used. The resulting diff Text object is constructed using the modified content elements.

Please integrate this code into your project, and let me know if you encounter any issues or have any questions. Once we have the diff Text object, we can move on to calculating the error rate and generating a formatted string with highlighted differences.

User
I don't think this approach is robust enough, since in general the two Text objects will not have the same Page/Segment/ContentElement structure.

I was thinking it would be better to extract a list of ContentElements from each Text object, use difflib to get an optimal diff of them, and then create a new Text object out of the result. Another instance of you wrote a similar function to merge the internalised "gloss" and "lemma" versions.

Does this sound okay?
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. Your approach of extracting a list of ContentElements from each Text object, using difflib to get an optimal diff, and creating a new Text object from the result is a better approach for handling the differences between the two texts.

Here's an updated version of the text_objects_to_diff function in clara_diff.py using this approach:

python
Copy code
import difflib
from clara_classes import Text, Page, Segment, ContentElement

def text_objects_to_diff(internalised_text1, internalised_text2, version):
    diff_pages = []
    for page1, page2 in zip(internalised_text1.pages, internalised_text2.pages):
        diff_segments = []
        for segment1, segment2 in zip(page1.segments, page2.segments):
            diff_content_elements = list(difflib.ndiff(
                [element.to_text() for element in segment1.content_elements],
                [element.to_text() for element in segment2.content_elements]
            ))
            content_elements = []
            for diff_element in diff_content_elements:
                if diff_element.startswith('- '):
                    content_elements.append(ContentElement("Deletion", diff_element[2:]))
                elif diff_element.startswith('+ '):
                    content_elements.append(ContentElement("Insertion", diff_element[2:]))
                else:
                    content_elements.append(ContentElement("Plain", diff_element[2:]))

            diff_segment = Segment(content_elements)
            diff_segments.append(diff_segment)

        diff_page = Page(diff_segments)
        diff_pages.append(diff_page)

    return Text(diff_pages, internalised_text1.l2_language, internalised_text1.l1_language)
In this updated implementation, we use difflib.ndiff to compute the differences between the text elements in each corresponding segment. The differences are marked as "Deletion" for removed elements, "Insertion" for added elements, and "Plain" for unchanged elements. The resulting diff Text object is constructed using these marked content elements.

Please integrate this updated code into your project, and let me know if you have any questions or face any issues. Once we have the diff Text object, we can move on to calculating the error rate and generating a formatted string with highlighted differences.
