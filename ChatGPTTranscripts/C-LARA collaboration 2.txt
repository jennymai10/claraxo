User
I am trying to debug a Django project that I developed with you in another thread. Unfortunately, that thread does not appear to be working right now. May I start by showing you the README for the project? 
ChatGPT
Absolutely, feel free to share your project's README. It should provide an overview of the project, its structure, dependencies, setup steps, and more. I'll do my best to help you with your debugging based on the information you provide.

User
Okay, here is the README:

1. Purpose of C-LARA

C-LARA is a complete reimplementation of the Learning And Reading Assistant
(LARA; https://www.unige.ch/callector/lara/) with ChatGPT-4 in the centre.
As with the original LARA, it provides a web platform where users can create and read
multimedia learner texts in many languages. In the original LARA, much of the work
needed to produce a multimedia text had to be performed manually. However, in C-LARA,
all the steps, including writing the text, can be carried out by ChatGPT-4, though
the result will typically contain a few minor errors. If a native speaker of the language
in question is available, the errors are usually very quick and easy to correct.
A simple editing interface is included.

In order to perform many of the key C-LARA operations, you need an OpenAI license key
enabled for gpt-4 API access. Unfortunately, the generally available gpt-3.5-turbo
license does not provide adequate performance for the kind of multilingual processing
required here.

2. Installation

2a. Python and packages

C-LARA is implemented in Python using the Django framework. You first need to install
Python 3.11. Make sure that 'python3' points to this version.

IMPORTANT: EARLIER VERSIONS OF PYTHON 3 MAY NOT WORK. WE KNOW THAT 3.9 IS INSUFFICIENT.

Check whether any of the packages Django, openai, tiktoken, gTTS, requests, jinja2,
retrying, regex, unidecode, whitenoise and configparser are not yet installed,
and if necessary install them.
The easiest way to do this is to carry out the following invocations to 'pip':

pip install Django
pip install configparser
pip install gTTS
pip install jinja2
pip install openai
pip install regex
pip install requests
pip install retrying
pip install tiktoken
pip install unidecode
pip install whitenoise

Pip itself can if necessary be installed following the instructions on this page:
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

2b. Downloading the code and other resources

Download the code from SourceForge at https://sourceforge.net/p/c-lara/svn/HEAD/tree/,
either as an SVN checkout or as a "snapshot" zipfile.

2c. Environment variables

Set the environment variable CLARA to the root directory of the material downloaded
from SourceForge. On my machine, it is set to C:\cygwin64\home\sf\c-lara-svn

Set the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY to the value of your OpenAI license key.

3. Running in development mode

Make sure that packages are installed and environment variables set as in (2) above. 

You should then be able to  start the server in development mode (i.e. running the system
on your local machine), by doing the following:

cd $CLARA
python3 manage.py runserver

C-LARA should then be accessible at http://localhost:8000/accounts/login/

If this does not work, please send a full trace to Emmanuel.Rayner@unige.ch.
We are still debugging the installation process and I will be responsive!

4. Organisation of material

Assuming the environment variable settings described in (2c) above, we will refer to
the root C-LARA directory as $CLARA.

The code is conceptually divided into two parts: the core Python code, and the Django layer.
Because of the way Django organises its directory structure, it is however technically
cleanest to make the core Python code a subdirectory of the Django directory.
The Django layer code is thus in the directory $CLARA/clara_app, and the core Python code
is in the directory $CLARA/clara_app/clara_core. Other directories are as described below.

4a. Core Python code

The top-level file in $CLARA/clara_app/clara_core is clara_main.py. This implements the class
CLARAProjectInternal, which performs all the internal operations. There is documentation
in clara_main.py describing what they are. A CLARAProjectInternal object is associated
with a directory which keeps the necessary text files.

The next most important file in $CLARA/clara_app/clara_code is clara_classes.py. This defines
the classes used for internal representation of text objects.

A full list of files follows.

clara_cefr.py: Call ChatGPT-4 to estimate CEFR reading level.

clara_chatgpt4.py: Send request to ChatGPT-4 through API.

clara_chatgpt4_manual.py: Send request to ChatGPT-4 through popup window (not used in live system).

clara_classes.py: Define classes used to for internal text representation.
The top-level class is called Text.

clara_concordance_annotator.py: Annotate a Text object with concordance information.

clara_create_annotations.py: Call ChatGPT-4 to add segmentation, gloss and lemma annotations to Text object.

clara_create_story.py: Call ChatGPT-4 to create a text.

clara_doc_summary.py: Collect together docstrings from files (not used in live system).

clara_internalise.py: Create Text object from human-friendly string representation.

clara_main.py: Top-level file: defines CLARAProjectInternal class, which gives access to all other functionality.
This file includes full documentation of the CLARAProjectInternal methods.

clara_merge_glossed_and_tagged.py: Combine Text objects derived by internalising "glossed" and "lemma-tagged"
strings into single Text object.

clara_openai.py: OpenAI utility functions.

clara_renderer.py: Render Text object as optionally self-contained directory of static HTML multimedia files.

clara_test.py: Test other functionality (not used in live system).

clara_tts_annotator.py: Annotate a Text object with TTS-generated audio information.

clara_tts_api.py: Code for calling third-party TTS engines.

clara_tts_repository.py: Manage repository which associates text strings with TTS-generated audio files.

clara_utils.py: Utility functions.

config.ini: Config file.

4b. Django layer

The Django layer is organised according to the standard conventions of Django MVC web apps.
The main material is in the directory $CLARA/clara_app. There is also some config and associated
material in the directory $CLARA/clara_project.

views.py defines the possible operations (creating a project, listing projects, performing some kind of
annotation, etc). An operation will in may cases involve accessing a CLARAProject object (defined in models.py)
and an associated CLARAProjectInternal object (defined in $CLARA/clara_core/clara_main.py).
Typically an operation may reference some or all of the following: a template from
$CLARA/clara_app/templates/clara_app, another database table from models.py and a form from forms.py.

urls.py defines an association between URL patterns in web requests and operations defined in views.py.

models.py defines SQLite3 database tables.

forms.py defines forms associated with database tables.

The 'templates' directory defines templates used for rendering the results of operations.
All the templates are in the subdirectory 'templates/clara_app'.

utils.py defines utility functions.

backends.py defines backend functionality.

4c. HTML templates used by core Python code

These are in the directory $CLARA/templates. There are four files:

alphabetical_vocabulary_list.html: Template for creating alphabetical vocabulary list page.

clara_page.html: Template for creating main C-LARA content page.

concordance_page.html: Template for creating concordance page.

frequency_vocabulary_list.html: Template for creating frequency-ordered vocabulary list page.

4d. CSS and JavaScript used by core Python code

These are in the directory $CLARA/static. There are two files:

clara_styles.css: CSS used by core Python code and included in generated multimedia.

clara_scripts.js: JavaScript used by core Python code and included in generated multimedia.




ChatGPT
Thank you for providing this comprehensive README. C-LARA seems to be a fascinating project, integrating powerful AI technology like ChatGPT-4 for multilingual processing and multimedia text generation.

In order to assist you with debugging this Django project, I'll need some additional information:

Errors or issues you are experiencing: This could be error messages you're seeing, unexpected behavior from the application, or features that aren't working as intended.

Where the issue lies: If you have an idea of which part of your application is causing the problem, please let me know. For example, is it a specific file or function in your code, or perhaps a particular user operation in your web interface?

What you've tried so far: Have you attempted any troubleshooting or debugging steps already? If so, what were they, and what was the result?

If you have any logs or tracebacks that relate to the problem, they could also be very helpful.

Remember, the more specific you can be about the problem, the more effectively I'll be able to assist you.

User
Thank you for your kind words, and of course I will give you details. The specific thing I was in the middle of doing was adding functionality to give users different privileges. This involved changing the default User model to a custom model and making a few related changes. Let me first give you the models.py file:

from django.db import models
from django.urls import reverse
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser

from .constants import SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES

from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser, Group, Permission
from django.db import models

class User(AbstractUser):
    is_admin = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    is_moderator = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    credit = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, default=0.0)

    groups = models.ManyToManyField(Group, blank=True, related_name="clara_app_users")
    user_permissions = models.ManyToManyField(Permission, blank=True, related_name="clara_app_users")


class CLARAProject(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    internal_id = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    l2 = models.CharField(max_length=50, choices=SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES)
    l1 = models.CharField(max_length=50, choices=SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES)
    
class CLARAProjectAction(models.Model):
    ACTION_CHOICES = [
        ('create', 'Create'),
        ('edit', 'Edit'),
    ]

    TEXT_VERSION_CHOICES = [
        ('plain', 'Plain'),
        ('segmented', 'Segmented'),
        ('gloss', 'Gloss'),
        ('lemma', 'Lemma'),
    ]

    project = models.ForeignKey(CLARAProject, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    action = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=ACTION_CHOICES)
    text_version = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=TEXT_VERSION_CHOICES)
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)

    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-timestamp']
        

class Content(models.Model):
    external_url = models.URLField(max_length=255, blank=True, null=True)
    project = models.OneToOneField(CLARAProject, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, blank=True, unique=True)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    l2 = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name='L2 Language')
    l1 = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name='L1 Language')
    length_in_words = models.IntegerField()
    author = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    voice = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    annotator = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    difficulty_level = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title

    def get_absolute_url(self):
        return reverse('content_detail', args=[str(self.id)])
        
    @property
    def url(self):
        if self.project:
            return reverse('serve_rendered_text', args=[self.project.id, 'page_1.html'])
        else:
            return self.external_url
            
class APICall(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    project = models.ForeignKey(CLARAProject, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField()
    operation = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    api_type = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    cost = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    duration = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    retries = models.IntegerField()
    prompt = models.TextField()
    response = models.TextField()

    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-timestamp']

the backends.py file:

from django.contrib.auth.backends import ModelBackend
from clara_app.models import User

class CustomUserModelBackend(ModelBackend):
    def get_user(self, user_id):
        try:
            return User.objects.get(pk=user_id)
        except User.DoesNotExist:
            return None

and what I understand are the relevant lines from the settings.py file:

AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'clara_app.User'

AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = ['clara_app.backends.CustomUserModelBackend']

# Password validation
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/#auth-password-validators

AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [
    {
        'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.UserAttributeSimilarityValidator',
    },
    {
        'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.MinimumLengthValidator',
    },
    {
        'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator',
    },
    {
        'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.NumericPasswordValidator',
    },
]
ChatGPT
The User model looks fine, and I don't see any glaring issues with your backends.py or settings.py either. However, without knowing what exactly is going wrong, it's hard to provide a concrete solution. Please provide more context around the problem. For example:

Are there any error messages?
What exactly is not working as expected?
Are there any changes in behavior that occurred after you made these changes?
If there are any stack traces, error messages, or logs you could provide, they would be especially useful.

As an additional note, if you've only just created the new User model and are experiencing issues, you may need to create a new migration for these changes and apply it with Django's migration commands:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
If you've already done this, ignore this suggestion. But if you haven't, it could be the source of your problem. The database needs to be updated whenever you make changes to your models. If you don't create and apply a migration, the database and your Django models will be out of sync, which can cause all sorts of issues.

User
I did a migration just to be sure, but I am up to date.

I think there is an inconsistency in the way the custom User model has been defined. When I try to register, I get this error message:

AttributeError at /accounts/register/

ChatGPT
The error you're seeing usually happens when you're trying to access a manager on a model that has been swapped out for a custom model. The manager being referred to here is usually the objects manager that Django provides by default on all models.

Since you've swapped the auth.User model for your custom clara_app.User model, any code in your application that tries to do something like auth.User.objects.all() would raise this error, because auth.User has been swapped out.

To resolve this, you would have to find any references to auth.User in your code, and replace them with clara_app.User. If you've done this in your own code but are still seeing the error, it's possible that a third-party library you're using still refers to auth.User. In that case, you would need to find a way to make that library use your custom user model.

Also, the error message says the issue is raised during clara_app.views.register. So you should start by checking the register view in clara_app.views. If you're using the User model there, make sure you're importing it correctly. That is, make sure you're doing from clara_app.models import User instead of from django.contrib.auth.models import User.

Without seeing the exact code in your register view, I can only provide these general suggestions. But you should start by checking all references to the User model in your register view. If you're still stuck after doing that, please provide the code for your register view, and I'll be happy to help you debug this further.

User
This was good advice, thank you. Here is the relevant code from views.py:

from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm

(...)

# Register a new account
def register(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = UserCreationForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            user = form.save()
            # Log the user in.
            login(request, user)
            return redirect('home')
    else:
        form = UserCreationForm()
    return render(request, 'clara_app/register.html', {'form': form})

I presume I need to create a form which inherits from django.contrib.auth.forms.UserCreationForm but uses clara_app.User instead of auth.User?
ChatGPT
Yes, you are correct. The UserCreationForm provided by Django uses the default User model from django.contrib.auth.models, and doesn't know anything about your custom user model or its additional fields.

You'll need to create a custom form for user registration. This custom form should inherit from UserCreationForm and use your custom User model. Here's an example of what that might look like:

python
Copy code
from django import forms
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm
from clara_app.models import User

class CustomUserCreationForm(UserCreationForm):
    class Meta(UserCreationForm.Meta):
        model = User
        fields = UserCreationForm.Meta.fields
Here, we're updating the Meta class within UserCreationForm to use your custom User model instead of the default one.

Then, in your view, you would use this new CustomUserCreationForm instead of the UserCreationForm:

python
Copy code
# Register a new account
def register(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = CustomUserCreationForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            user = form.save()
            # Log the user in.
            login(request, user)
            return redirect('home')
    else:
        form = CustomUserCreationForm()
    return render(request, 'clara_app/register.html', {'form': form})
This should allow your registration view to properly use your custom User model when creating new users. If your User model has additional fields you want to include in the registration form, you would add them to the fields list in the CustomUserCreationForm's Meta class.

User
Thank you, more good advice! I made those changes, and now I can register and log in. I am checking that other functionality works.
ChatGPT
You're welcome! I'm glad to hear that you're making progress. Now that you have updated your User model and created a custom user creation form, your application should be able to register and manage users as expected.

Please don't hesitate to ask if you encounter any other issues or have further questions about Django or any other programming topic. Remember, when you make changes, especially changes related to database models like this, it's good practice to thoroughly test your application to ensure everything is working properly. This includes not only user registration and authentication, but also any other functionality that may be related to users in some way.

User
I would like to add some more functionality. But let me first show you the views.py file, so that you understand better what C-LARA does. I think I will need to give it to you in two parts. Here is the first half:

Thank you for sharing the first half of your views.py file. From the code provided, I can see that C-LARA is an application intended for language processing tasks. Users are able to register, create projects (associated with specific language pairs), and work with different versions of text - plain, segmented, and glossed.

From your views, I can infer that:

Users can register and login, and view their profile.
Users can register content from web sources, view their registered content and details of specific content.
Users can create, list and view the details of their language projects.
Users can create different versions of text for each project: plain, segmented, and glossed.
The management of credit balance and the logging of API calls indicate that some of the operations might be cost-associated.

Please go ahead and share the remaining part of your views.py or any other relevant code you want me to look at, or let me know what additional functionality you'd like to implement or questions you have.

Here's a summary of the functions from the second half of the code:

create_lemma_tagged_text(request, project_id): This view handles the creation or editing of lemma-tagged versions of the text for a given project. If the form is valid and the choice of text is manual, it saves the text. Otherwise, it generates a lemma-tagged text version through API calls, stores these API calls, and returns the form with the lemma-tagged text and success set to True. If an error occurs, the function handles it by loading a segmented text version or using an empty string if that also fails.

project_history(request, project_id): This view retrieves and displays the history of updates to project files. It orders the actions by timestamp.

render_text(request, project_id): This view renders the text from the internal representation to create a directory of static HTML files. Before rendering, it checks whether glossed and lemma-tagged versions of the text exist. If so, it renders the text, moves the generated HTML files to a web-accessible directory, creates a zip file of the directory, and finally renders a page with links to the content and the zip file.

register_project_content(request, project_id): This view registers the content produced by a project. If the form is valid and the user chose to register the content, it gets or creates a new Content object with the provided details and updates any fields that might have changed.

serve_rendered_text(request, project_id, filename), serve_rendered_text_static(request, project_id, filename), and serve_rendered_text_multimedia(request, project_id, filename): These views serve static files such as HTML, CSS, JS, or multimedia files from a given path. If the file doesn't exist, they return a 404 error.

serve_zipfile(request, project_id): This view serves a zip file of rendered texts for a project. It returns the file as an attachment. If the zip file doesn't exist, it raises a 404 error.

Please let me know if there are any specific parts of the code you would like me to explain in more detail.

User
I have written this code in consultation with another instance of you and understand it well. It's more that I wanted to bring you up to date.

Here is the docstring from the file clara_app/clara_core/clara_main.py, which is the interface to the internal processing functions:

"""
Define the CLARAProjectInternal class. An object in this class collects together the data
required to build a multimodal C-LARA text out of a plain text, using ChatGPT to perform
text generation and annotation, and third-party resources like TTS engines to add
other information.

Each CLARAProjectInternal object is associated with a directory, which contains the various
text representations related to the object. These texts are kept as files since they
can be very large. We have four types of text, as follows:

"plain". The initial unformatted text.
"segmented". Text with segmentation annotations added.
"gloss". Text with segmentation annotations plus a gloss annotations for each word.
"lemma". Text with segmentation annotations plus a lemma annotation for each word.

The main methods are the following:

- CLARAProjectInternal(id, l2_language, l1_language). Constructor. Creates necessary directories for
an initial empty project.

- from_directory(directory) [classmethod]. Creates a CLARAProjectInternal from its associated directory.

- save_text_version(version, text). Saves one of the associated texts. "version" is one
of ( "plain", "segmented", "gloss", "lemma" ).

- load_text_version(version). Retrieves one of the associated texts. "version" is one
of ( "plain", "segmented", "gloss", "lemma" ).

- create_plain_text(prompt=None). Calls ChatGPT-4 to create the initial plain text in l2_language.
Returns a list of APICall instances related to the operation.

- get_cefr_level(). Calls ChatGPT-4 to estimate the CEFR level or uses a cached value, and returns
a tuple where the first element is a string representing the CEFR level,
and the second element is a list of APICall instances related to the operation.

- create_segmented_text(). Calls ChatGPT-4 to annotate the "plain" version with
segmentation annotations and saves the result as the "segmented" version.

ChatGPT
The CLARAProjectInternal class in clara_main.py is an internal representation of a project that facilitates the generation, annotation, and management of multimodal C-LARA text. It interacts with language models such as ChatGPT to generate and annotate the text, and interfaces with other resources like TTS engines.

The class utilizes four text representations: "plain", "segmented", "gloss", and "lemma". These versions exist as files due to their potentially large sizes. The respective functions allow creating, saving, and loading these text versions.

Here's a brief overview of the main methods:

CLARAProjectInternal(id, l2_language, l1_language): Constructor method for creating an empty project with necessary directories.

from_directory(directory): A class method that generates a CLARAProjectInternal object from a given directory.

save_text_version(version, text): Method to save a given text version. Accepts "version" types of "plain", "segmented", "gloss", or "lemma".

load_text_version(version): Method to retrieve a saved text version. Again, accepts "version" types of "plain", "segmented", "gloss", or "lemma".

create_plain_text(prompt=None): Method to use ChatGPT-4 for creating initial plain text in the provided l2_language.

get_cefr_level(): Method to estimate or retrieve a cached CEFR level for the text.

create_segmented_text(), create_glossed_text(), create_lemma_tagged_text(): Methods to annotate the text with segmentation, gloss, and lemma annotations respectively. These require the previous version to exist (e.g., segmented needs plain, gloss needs segmented, lemma needs segmented).

get_internalised_and_annotated_text(): This method returns a Text object (as defined in clara_classes.py) that encapsulates the text along with all its annotations. It requires both "gloss" and "lemma" versions to exist.

render_text(self_contained=False): Method to render the text as an optionally self-contained directory of HTML pages. If self-contained, it includes all the referenced multimedia files.

get_word_count(): Returns the word count of the project text, or 'Unknown' if not available.

get_voice(): Returns the voice as a string, or 'Unknown' if not available.

This encapsulated and organized structure facilitates easy management and manipulation of text for the given project.

ChatGPT
Your models.py file defines the Django database models for your application. Let's walk through the classes:

User is a subclass of Django's AbstractUser, providing default authentication fields with added is_admin, is_moderator, and credit fields. It also adds relationships with Group and Permission models.

CLARAProject is the main project class that contains the title, internal_id, user, and language attributes (l1 and l2). The user attribute is a foreign key linking to the User model.

CLARAProjectAction records the actions made on a project. It includes fields for the associated CLARAProject (foreign key), action type, text_version (which type of text the action was made on), timestamp, and user. The Meta subclass specifies that instances should be ordered by timestamp in descending order.

Content encapsulates metadata about content related to a CLARAProject. It stores fields such as external_url, title, l2 and l1 languages, length_in_words, author, voice, annotator, difficulty_level, and an associated CLARAProject (one-to-one relationship). There are also some methods defined for this class.

__str__ method: Returns the title of the content. Used when a string representation of the object is needed.

get_absolute_url method: Returns a URL that can be used to access the detail view of this object. Useful for redirect operations.

url property: Returns the URL of the associated project or the external URL.

APICall logs API calls related to a CLARAProject. This includes fields for the associated User and CLARAProject (foreign keys), timestamp, operation type, api_type, cost, duration, retries, prompt, and response. The Meta subclass specifies that instances should be ordered by timestamp in descending order.

Remember, these models will be used by Django to create the necessary database schema. Django's ORM will allow you to interact with your data like regular Python objects while Django does the underlying database operations.

User
Excellent! That is a good summary.

Now, I would like to add another view that will make it possible to add credit to a User. This view should only be accessible to Users who have admin privileges. So we are using the 'is_admin' and 'credit' fields of 'User':

class User(AbstractUser):
    is_admin = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    is_moderator = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    credit = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, default=0.0)

    groups = models.ManyToManyField(Group, blank=True, related_name="clara_app_users")
    user_permissions = models.ManyToManyField(Permission, blank=True, related_name="clara_app_users")

How do you see this working?
ChatGPT
To implement this feature, you'll need to create a new view that handles adding credit to a user. Here's a general outline of the steps you need to take:

Create a form for adding credit: This form would typically have two fields, a user selection field and a decimal field for the amount of credit to add.

Create a view function to handle the form: This function will display the form to the admin user, validate the submitted form data, and update the user's credit if the form data is valid. This view should only be accessible to admin users, which you can enforce using Django's built-in user authentication system.

Map a URL to your view: This will allow users to navigate to the page that displays your form.

Update your template to include the form: The form will be rendered into HTML and displayed to the user.

Here's an example of what your form, view, and URL configuration might look like.

In your forms.py file:

python
Copy code
from django import forms
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model

User = get_user_model()

class AddCreditForm(forms.Form):
    user = forms.ModelChoiceField(queryset=User.objects.all())
    credit = forms.DecimalField()
In your views.py file:

python
Copy code
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import user_passes_test
from .forms import AddCreditForm

@user_passes_test(lambda u: u.is_admin)
def add_credit_view(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = AddCreditForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            user = form.cleaned_data['user']
            credit = form.cleaned_data['credit']
            user.credit += credit
            user.save()
    else:
        form = AddCreditForm()
    return render(request, 'add_credit.html', {'form': form})
In your urls.py file:

python
Copy code
from .views import add_credit_view

urlpatterns = [
    # Your other URL patterns...
    path('add-credit/', add_credit_view, name='add-credit'),
]
In your add_credit.html template:

html
Copy code
<form method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form.as_p }}
    <button type="submit">Add Credit</button>
</form>
This setup will create a new page at /add-credit/ where admin users can add credit to users. The user_passes_test decorator is used to restrict access to this view to admin users only.

User
This mostly looks good, a couple of queries:

1. In forms.py, I was expecting something like this:

from .models import User

class AddCreditForm(forms.Form):
    user = forms.ModelChoiceField(queryset=User.objects.all())
    credit = forms.DecimalField()

since we have a custom User model in .models.py

2. In view.py, is there anything wrong with having a second decorator, like so?

# Add credit to account
@login_required
@user_passes_test(lambda u: u.is_admin)
def add_credit(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = AddCreditForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            user = form.cleaned_data['user']
            credit = form.cleaned_data['credit']
            user.credit += credit
            user.save()
    else:
        form = AddCreditForm()
    return render(request, 'add_credit.html', {'form': form})

ChatGPT
You're correct. In your case, you have a custom User model in your application. So, you should import it directly from your models. My previous response uses the get_user_model function to avoid potential issues with circular imports in certain scenarios, but if you know you're importing from your own models.py, then directly importing User is just fine.

Yes, you can certainly use the @login_required decorator along with @user_passes_test. The @login_required decorator ensures that the user is logged in, while @user_passes_test ensures that the user meets the conditions specified in the test, in this case being an admin. Here's what it would look like:

python
Copy code
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required, user_passes_test
from .forms import AddCreditForm

@login_required
@user_passes_test(lambda u: u.is_admin)
def add_credit_view(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = AddCreditForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            user = form.cleaned_data['user']
            credit = form.cleaned_data['credit']
            user.credit += credit
            user.save()
    else:
        form = AddCreditForm()
    return render(request, 'add_credit.html', {'form': form})
Using both decorators in this way will ensure that only logged-in users who are also admins can access the view. If a user who is not logged in tries to access this view, they will be redirected to the login page. If a user who is not an admin tries to access this view, they will receive a 403 Forbidden error.

User
Great! One more question: I want to set myself to have admin privileges. What is a simple way to do that?
ChatGPT
Setting admin privileges will typically involve interacting with the User model in Django. Here's a simple way to grant a user admin privileges from the Django shell:

Enter the Django shell by running this command in your terminal:

Copy code
python manage.py shell
Once you're in the Django shell, run the following commands to give your user admin privileges. Be sure to replace 'username' with the actual username of the user you want to make an admin:

python
Copy code
from clara_app.models import User  # replace "clara_app" with your app name if it's different
user = User.objects.get(username='username')
user.is_admin = True
user.save()
You can then exit the Django shell by typing exit().

After running these commands, the specified user will have admin privileges. Remember that these privileges should be handled carefully and only given to trusted users.

User
Thank you, no problem giving myself admin privileges.

Now,  I would like to make the new 'add_credit' view easily accessible. I have the other top-level functions in menus defined in the template base.html:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">

</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        {% if user.is_authenticated %}
		  <li><a href="{% url 'credit_balance' %}">Credit balance for ChatGPT-4 API calls</a></li>

        {% else %}
          <li><a href="{% url 'login' %}">Login</a></li>
          <li><a href="{% url 'register' %}">Register</a></li>
        {% endif %}
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>

  <main>
    {% block content %}
    {% endblock %}
  </main>
</body>
</html>

How can I add a link to add_credit, visible only to users with admin privileges?
ChatGPT
You can check for user permissions in your templates using the user object. This object has an attribute is_admin that will be True if the user is an admin. You can use this in an {% if %} statement in your template to conditionally display the link to add_credit only for admin users.

Here's how you can add the link to the 'add_credit' view in your navigation bar:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">
  <title>{% block title %}C-LARA{% endblock %}</title>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        {% if user.is_authenticated %}
		  <li><a href="{% url 'credit_balance' %}">Credit balance for ChatGPT-4 API calls</a></li>
		  <li><a href="{% url 'create_project' %}">Create new C-LARA project</a></li>
		  <li><a href="{% url 'project_list' %}">List your C-LARA projects</a></li>
		  <li><a href="{% url 'content_list' %}">List registered content</a></li>
		  <li><a href="{% url 'register_content' %}">Register external LARA content</a></li>
          {% if user.is_admin %}
            <li><a href="{% url 'add_credit' %}">Add credit to user</a></li>
          {% endif %}
          <li><a href="{% url 'logout' %}">Logout</a></li>
        {% else %}
          <li><a href="{% url 'login' %}">Login</a></li>
          <li><a href="{% url 'register' %}">Register</a></li>
        {% endif %}
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>

  <main>
    {% block content %}
    {% endblock %}
  </main>
</body>
</html>
In this code, the line {% if user.is_admin %} checks if the user is an admin, and if they are, it displays the link to add_credit. If the user is not an admin, the link will not be displayed.

User
Thank you, that all worked well! I can add credit to my account and see it in the credit_balance view, which I have modified to look like this:

# Credit balance for money spent on API calls    
@login_required
def credit_balance(request):
    total_cost = get_user_api_cost(request.user)
    credit_balance = request.user.credit - total_cost  
    return render(request, 'clara_app/credit_balance.html', {'credit_balance': credit_balance})
ChatGPT
You're welcome! I'm glad to hear that it's working as expected. Your credit_balance view now retrieves the total API cost and calculates the remaining credit for the logged in user. The remaining credit balance is then passed into the 'clara_app/credit_balance.html' template where it can be displayed to the user.

As you continue developing your application, feel free to return with any other questions or issues you might have. I'm here to help!

User
Okay, now here's another piece of functionality that has been discussed and would clearly be useful. We currently have a view that shows a piece of content:

# Display information for a specific piece of content
@login_required
def content_detail(request, content_id):
    content = get_object_or_404(Content, id=content_id)
    return render(request, 'clara_app/content_detail.html', {'content': content})

with template

{% extends 'clara_app/base.html' %}

{% block content %}
  <h2>{{ content.title }}</h2>
  <p>URL: <a href="{{ content.url }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">{{ content.url }}</a></p>
  <p>L2: {{ content.l2 }}</p>
  <p>L1: {{ content.l1 }}</p>
  <p>Length in words: {{ content.length_in_words }}</p>
  <p>Author: {{ content.author }}</p>
  <p>Voice: {{ content.voice }}</p>
  <p>Annotator: {{ content.annotator }}</p>
  <p>Difficulty Level: {{ content.difficulty_level }}</p>
{% endblock %}

It seems like a good idea to add some basic social network functionality, so that users can give ratings to pieces of content and add comments to a comment thread. The comment thread would be displayed using pagination functionality to provide the usual navigation controls.

How does this sound to you?
ChatGPT
Your idea of adding a social feature to your application sounds excellent! This would indeed improve user interaction and engagement with the content. Here are some suggestions on how you can achieve this:

Rating: You can create a new model named Rating to store user ratings for each Content. The model might have fields such as user, content, and rating. When a user rates a content, a new Rating instance will be created. The rating for a piece of content can be calculated as the average rating from all users who have rated the content.

Comments: Similarly, you can create a new model named Comment to store user comments for each Content. This model might have fields such as user, content, comment, and timestamp.

Here's a quick sketch of these two models:

python
Copy code
class Rating(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    content = models.ForeignKey(Content, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    rating = models.PositiveSmallIntegerField()

class Comment(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    content = models.ForeignKey(Content, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    comment = models.TextField()
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
You will need to add forms and views for users to submit ratings and comments. When displaying a piece of content, you can fetch all comments related to that content and display them.

For the comment pagination, Django provides built-in support for this. You can use the Paginator class in Django to handle the pagination of the comments.

In your templates, you will have to add forms to let users add ratings and comments, and display the list of comments. For ratings, you could also display the average rating for a piece of content.

Please note that this is a brief outline of the functionality you could implement and there can be more details you need to handle according to your specific requirements, such as checking that a user does not rate the same content multiple times, handling permissions, displaying error messages, etc.

User
Yes, this seems like a good start!

As you say, a user shouldn't be able to add more than one rating to a piece of content, but they should be allowed to change their rating. So maybe the definition in models.py can reflect that?
ChatGPT
Yes, absolutely! To enforce the constraint that a user can only rate a piece of content once but can update their rating, you can use a OneToOneField relation from the User model to the Content model in the Rating model. This would enforce that a user can only have one rating per content at the database level.

The updated Rating model would look something like this:

python
Copy code
class Rating(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    content = models.ForeignKey(Content, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    rating = models.PositiveSmallIntegerField()
However, this change alone would not suffice. This is because while the OneToOneField would ensure a user can only have one rating per content, it does not specify which content. As it stands, this model implies a user can only rate one piece of content in total, which is not what you want.

In order to enforce a unique constraint on the combination of the user and content fields, you can use Django's unique_together option in the Meta class. This would look like this:

python
Copy code
class Rating(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    content = models.ForeignKey(Content, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    rating = models.PositiveSmallIntegerField()

    class Meta:
        unique_together = (('user', 'content'),)
This way, a user can rate as many different pieces of content as they want, but they can only rate each piece of content once. If they attempt to rate the same piece of content again, it would be an update operation rather than a create operation.

User
We're making excellent progress here! I have added these new items to models.py:

class Rating(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    content = models.ForeignKey(Content, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    rating = models.PositiveSmallIntegerField()

    class Meta:
        unique_together = (('user', 'content'),)
        
class Comment(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    content = models.ForeignKey(Content, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    comment = models.TextField()
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    
Though on thinking about it, probably the value of 'rating' should be a number from 1 to 5, and we should enforce this?

Yes, indeed! If you want to enforce that the rating is a number from 1 to 5, you can add validators to your rating field. Django provides a MinValueValidator and MaxValueValidator for this purpose.

Here's how you would implement this:

python
Copy code
from django.core.validators import MaxValueValidator, MinValueValidator

class Rating(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    content = models.ForeignKey(Content, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    rating = models.PositiveSmallIntegerField(
        validators=[MinValueValidator(1), MaxValueValidator(5)]
    )

    class Meta:
        unique_together = (('user', 'content'),)
This way, Django will automatically validate that the rating is within the correct range before saving a Rating object. If the rating is not within this range, a ValidationError will be raised.

Remember to import the necessary validators at the beginning of your models.py file:

python
Copy code
from django.core.validators import MaxValueValidator, MinValueValidator
With this setup, when you attempt to save a Rating instance with a rating outside of the range 1-5, Django will raise a ValidationError.

User
Or how about just limiting it explicitly to the values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), since we will presumably want to let the user select the rating value from some kind of menu?
ChatGPT
Yes, that sounds like a great idea! If you want to limit the choices to specific values, you can use the choices option on your rating field. Here's how you would do this:

python
Copy code
class Rating(models.Model):
    RATING_CHOICES = [
        (1, '1 - Poor'),
        (2, '2 - Fair'),
        (3, '3 - Good'),
        (4, '4 - Very Good'),
        (5, '5 - Excellent'),
    ]

    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    content = models.ForeignKey(Content, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    rating = models.PositiveSmallIntegerField(choices=RATING_CHOICES)

    class Meta:
        unique_together = (('user', 'content'),)
In this setup, Django will enforce that the value of the rating field must be one of the specified choices. The user will be able to select from these ratings, which will also provide a brief description for each rating level. This will be more user-friendly and intuitive than simply selecting a number.

User
Great! I have added the modified version of Rating.

So next, how can we modify the content_detail code in views to show ratings and comments, and let users enter new ratings and comments?
ChatGPT
Great! Now we can proceed with the updates to the content_detail view function and related template.

Firstly, we need to create forms for the Rating and Comment models. You can do that in your forms.py file as follows:

python
Copy code
from .models import Rating, Comment
from django import forms

# other forms ...

class RatingForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Rating
        fields = ['rating']

class CommentForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Comment
        fields = ['comment']
Then, in views.py, you can update the content_detail function to handle the form submissions and to pass the necessary data to the template:

python
Copy code
from .forms import RatingForm, CommentForm

# other imports ...

@login_required
def content_detail(request, content_id):
    content = get_object_or_404(Content, id=content_id)
    rating_form = RatingForm(request.POST or None)
    comment_form = CommentForm(request.POST or None)
    comments = Comment.objects.filter(content=content).order_by('-timestamp')
    rating = Rating.objects.filter(content=content, user=request.user).first()

    if rating_form.is_valid() and comment_form.is_valid():
        new_rating = rating_form.save(commit=False)
        new_rating.user = request.user
        new_rating.content = content
        if rating:
            rating.rating = new_rating.rating
            rating.save()
        else:
            new_rating.save()

        new_comment = comment_form.save(commit=False)
        new_comment.user = request.user
        new_comment.content = content
        new_comment.save()

        return redirect('content_detail', content_id=content_id)

    return render(request, 'clara_app/content_detail.html', {
        'content': content,
        'rating_form': rating_form,
        'comment_form': comment_form,
        'comments': comments,
    })
Lastly, in content_detail.html template, you can show the forms and the existing ratings and comments:

html
Copy code
{% extends 'clara_app/base.html' %}

{% block content %}
  <h2>{{ content.title }}</h2>
  <p>URL: <a href="{{ content.url }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">{{ content.url }}</a></p>
  <!-- existing fields ... -->

  <!-- Add rating form -->
  <form method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ rating_form.as_p }}
    <button type="submit">Submit rating</button>
  </form>

  <!-- Add comment form -->
  <form method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ comment_form.as_p }}
    <button type="submit">Submit comment</button>
  </form>

  <!-- Show comments -->
  {% for comment in comments %}
    <p>
      <strong>{{ comment.user.username }}</strong> 
      ({{ comment.timestamp|date:"F j, Y, P" }}):
      {{ comment.comment }}
    </p>
  {% endfor %}
{% endblock %}
This implementation has pagination left out for simplicity. If the number of comments can get very large, you should add pagination. For rating, it is assumed that a user can only rate once but can update the rating. Note that this does not handle errors or invalid form submissions elegantly. You should add error handling and user feedback as appropriate for your application.

Please review the changes above and let me know if anything is unclear!

User
This looks good, but something is not quite right yet. When I display a registered piece of content, I see this:

[base menu]

french story
URL: /accounts/rendered_texts/1/page_1.html

L2: french

L1: english

Length in words: 280

Author: mannyrayner

Voice: google_fr_default

Annotator: mannyrayner

Difficulty Level: B1

Rating:    [drop-down menu]
---------

Submit rating  [button]
Comment:    [text box]

Submit comment  [button]

That looks correct. But when I select a rating value and press Submit rating, what I see at the bottom is:

Rating: 
3 - Good  [value selected]

Submit rating [button]
This field is required. [error message?]

etc.
ChatGPT
The issue you are seeing could be due to the fact that both forms are submitted when either button is pressed because they both have method "post" without a specific action. The error message "This field is required" is displayed when a form fails validation, in this case, it is likely because the Comment form is also being submitted (without any input) when you submit the Rating form.

To fix this, you might want to handle each form submission separately. You can do this by assigning different names to the Submit buttons and checking which one has been pressed in the view. Here's how you can modify your existing code:

In content_detail.html, add name attribute to the buttons:

html
Copy code
<!-- Add rating form -->
<form method="post">
  {% csrf_token %}
  {{ rating_form.as_p }}
  <button type="submit" name="submit_rating">Submit rating</button>
</form>

<!-- Add comment form -->
<form method="post">
  {% csrf_token %}
  {{ comment_form.as_p }}
  <button type="submit" name="submit_comment">Submit comment</button>
</form>
And then in views.py, you check which button was pressed:

python
Copy code
@login_required
def content_detail(request, content_id):
    content = get_object_or_404(Content, id=content_id)
    comments = Comment.objects.filter(content=content).order_by('-timestamp')
    rating = Rating.objects.filter(content=content, user=request.user).first()

    if request.method == 'POST':
        if 'submit_rating' in request.POST:
            rating_form = RatingForm(request.POST)
            if rating_form.is_valid():
                new_rating = rating_form.save(commit=False)
                new_rating.user = request.user
                new_rating.content = content
                if rating:
                    rating.rating = new_rating.rating
                    rating.save()
                else:
                    new_rating.save()
            comment_form = CommentForm()  # initialize empty comment form
        elif 'submit_comment' in request.POST:
            comment_form = CommentForm(request.POST)
            if comment_form.is_valid():
                new_comment = comment_form.save(commit=False)
                new_comment.user = request.user
                new_comment.content = content
                new_comment.save()
            rating_form = RatingForm()  # initialize empty rating form
        return redirect('content_detail', content_id=content_id)
    else:
        rating_form = RatingForm()
        comment_form = CommentForm()

    return render(request, 'clara_app/content_detail.html', {
        'content': content,
        'rating_form': rating_form,
        'comment_form': comment_form,
        'comments': comments,
    })
This way, only the form associated with the button that was pressed will be submitted and validated.

User
This is a big improvement! I can enter comments and they are displayed as intended. However, we are still not displaying any ratings... how can we do that?
ChatGPT
To display the average rating for a piece of content, you can first calculate the average of the ratings in your view function and then pass it to your template.

You can calculate the average rating in the content_detail view with something like this:

python
Copy code
average_rating = Rating.objects.filter(content=content).aggregate(Avg('rating'))
You would need to import Avg from django.db.models for this to work:

python
Copy code
from django.db.models import Avg
This will give you a dictionary with one key-value pair, with 'rating__avg' as the key and the average rating as the value.

Then, you pass the average rating to the template:

python
Copy code
return render(request, 'clara_app/content_detail.html', {
    'content': content,
    'rating_form': rating_form,
    'comment_form': comment_form,
    'comments': comments,
    'average_rating': average_rating['rating__avg'],
})
And in your template, you can display the average rating like this:

html
Copy code
<p>Average Rating: {{ average_rating }}</p>
Keep in mind that if no ratings exist for a piece of content, average_rating['rating__avg'] will be None. You might want to handle this case in your template:

html
Copy code
{% if average_rating %}
  <p>Average Rating: {{ average_rating }}</p>
{% else %}
  <p>No ratings yet</p>
{% endif %}
Note: If you want to display the average rating with a certain number of decimal places, you can use Django's floatformat template tag. For example, {{ average_rating|floatformat:2 }} will display the average rating with 2 decimal places.

User
All of that worked fine, thank you!

Here is another piece of functionality it would be useful to add. Right now, when you create a project, you often give it a generic title like 'French story' because you are going tell ChatGPT-4 to create the text and you don't yet know what it's going to be. But after the text has been created, you'll typically want to change the title to something specific.

It would consequently be useful to include functionality, probably in the 'project_detail' view, which allows you to change the 'title' field in a project. Here is the relevant code from views.py:

# Display a project
@login_required
def project_detail(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    return render(request, 'clara_app/project_detail.html', {'project': project})

here is the model for CLARAProject from models.py:

class CLARAProject(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    internal_id = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    l2 = models.CharField(max_length=50, choices=SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES)
    l1 = models.CharField(max_length=50, choices=SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES)
    
and here is the template for project_detail.html:

{% extends "clara_app/base.html" %}

{% block content %}
	<h1>{{ project.title }}</h1>
	<p>L2 Language: {{ project.l2 }}</p>
	<p>L1 Language: {{ project.l1 }}</p>
	<p><a href="{% url 'create_plain_text' project.id %}">Create/Edit Plain Text</a></p>
	<p><a href="{% url 'create_segmented_text' project.id %}">Create/Edit Segmented Text</a></p>
	<p><a href="{% url 'create_glossed_text' project.id %}">Create/Edit Glossed Text</a></p>
	<p><a href="{% url 'create_lemma_tagged_text' project.id %}">Create/Edit Lemma Tagged Text</a></p>
	<p><a href="{% url 'render_text' project.id %}">Render Text</a></p>
	<p><a href="{% url 'project_history' project.id %}">View Project History</a></p>
{% endblock %}

What are your thoughts?
ChatGPT
Adding the ability to change the title of a project seems like a good idea and it should be fairly straightforward to implement.

Here's how you might do it:

First, you'll need to create a form to handle changing the title of a project. This form can be quite simple and might look like this:
python
Copy code
# forms.py
from django import forms

class UpdateProjectTitleForm(forms.Form):
    new_title = forms.CharField(max_length=200)
You then need to add the ability to handle the new form in the project_detail view. The view needs to check if the request method is 'POST', validate the form, and then save the new title if the form is valid.
python
Copy code
# views.py
from .forms import UpdateProjectTitleForm

@login_required
def project_detail(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = UpdateProjectTitleForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            project.title = form.cleaned_data['new_title']
            project.save()
    else:
        form = UpdateProjectTitleForm()
    return render(request, 'clara_app/project_detail.html', {'project': project, 'form': form})
Finally, you need to add the form to your template, perhaps at the top of the page before the project details.
html
Copy code
{% extends "clara_app/base.html" %}

{% block content %}
    <form method="post">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form.as_p }}
        <button type="submit">Update Title</button>
    </form>
	<h1>{{ project.title }}</h1>
    ...
{% endblock %}
This will allow you to change the title of a project by entering a new title into the form and clicking "Update Title".

As always, please ensure you have the necessary permissions checks in place to ensure that only authorized users can change the title of a project.

User
Thank you, that all worked as intended! But good point about the permissions checks. For the view code, we currently have

@login_required
def project_detail(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = UpdateProjectTitleForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            project.title = form.cleaned_data['new_title']
            project.save()
    else:
        form = UpdateProjectTitleForm()
    return render(request, 'clara_app/project_detail.html', {'project': project, 'form': form})

But I think that really we should have another decorator in place to check not just that the user is logged in, but also that that they are the owner of this project. And similarly for related operations carried out on projects.

Does that sound right to you?
ChatGPT
Yes, you're absolutely correct. Not only should users be authenticated, but they also should have the necessary permissions to perform certain actions like updating the title of a project. In Django, this can be done with the help of decorators or mixins depending on the type of view function based or class based.

Let's write a decorator to check if the logged-in user is the owner of the project. We can apply this decorator to the project_detail view to ensure that the user can only update the title of a project if they are the owner of the project.

Here is an example of how you can define the decorator:

python
Copy code
from functools import wraps
from django.core.exceptions import PermissionDenied

def user_is_project_owner(function):
    @wraps(function)
    def wrap(request, *args, **kwargs):
        project = CLARAProject.objects.get(pk=kwargs['project_id'])
        if project.user != request.user:
            raise PermissionDenied
        else:
            return function(request, *args, **kwargs)
    return wrap
You can now apply this decorator to your project_detail view function like so:

python
Copy code
@login_required
@user_is_project_owner
def project_detail(request, project_id):
    # rest of the view
With this setup, if a user who is not the owner of the project tries to access the project_detail view, they will receive a 403 Forbidden response. You may want to create a custom 403 error page to provide a more user-friendly error message.

Also, make sure to use this decorator for all views that should be restricted to the project owner.

User
This absolutely sounds like what we need, but I am not sufficiently conversant with decorators to be sure I've understood the details of the above. Does the line

project = CLARAProject.objects.get(pk=kwargs['project_id'])

mean that the project id will be passed as an argument specifically called 'project_id'?
ChatGPT
Yes, exactly. The variable kwargs in the decorator function contains all keyword arguments that are passed to the view function. When Django processes a URL, it passes any captured parameters from the URL as keyword arguments to the view function.

In your case, project_id is captured from the URL and passed to the project_detail view as a keyword argument. That's why we use kwargs['project_id'] to access the project_id inside the decorator function.

Here's how it works:

When Django processes a URL (for example, '/project/5/'), it uses the URL configuration to map the URL to a view function.
If the URL configuration includes a parameter (like '5' in the example), Django captures that parameter and passes it to the view function. In your case, the parameter is project_id.
The decorator function wraps the view function. This means that when the view function is called, the decorator function is called instead.
Inside the decorator function, you have access to all arguments that are passed to the view function, including request and project_id.
So, in the line project = CLARAProject.objects.get(pk=kwargs['project_id']), we're simply getting the CLARAProject instance with the primary key equal to project_id.

This pattern is commonly used in Django when you have a URL that includes an object id, and you want to perform some action on that object.

User
Thank you, all of that is now working fine!

Here is another feature that would obviously be useful: we want to be able to delete a project. This could be another control in the 'project_detail' view, or alternately we could add a 'delete' checkbox after each project in the 'project_list' view.

What are your thoughts?
ChatGPT
Adding the ability to delete a project is indeed a crucial feature in many applications. Here are a couple of options:

Delete button in the project_detail view: This is a common approach. You could add a Delete button at the bottom of the project detail page. When the user clicks the button, you would ask for confirmation (to avoid accidental deletions), and then delete the project if the user confirms. Here is how you could implement this in your view:

python
Copy code
@login_required
@check_project_permission
def project_detail(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        if 'update_title' in request.POST:
            form = UpdateProjectTitleForm(request.POST)
            if form.is_valid():
                project.title = form.cleaned_data['new_title']
                project.save()
        elif 'delete_project' in request.POST:
            project.delete()
            return redirect('project_list')
    else:
        form = UpdateProjectTitleForm()
    return render(request, 'clara_app/project_detail.html', {'project': project, 'form': form})
In your template, you would add a new form for deleting the project:

html
Copy code
<form method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <input type="submit" name="delete_project" value="Delete Project">
</form>
Delete checkbox in the project_list view: This is also a common approach, especially when you want to allow users to delete multiple projects at once. You would add a checkbox next to each project in the list, and a Delete button at the bottom of the page. When the user checks one or more checkboxes and clicks the Delete button, you would delete all selected projects.

Implementing this is a bit more complex than the first option, because you need to handle the case where multiple projects are selected. You would also need to ensure that the user has permission to delete each selected project.

For your use case, I would recommend starting with the first option (delete button in the project_detail view). It's simpler to implement, and it's a good fit for the level of complexity of your current application. As your application grows and the need arises, you can always add the ability to delete multiple projects from the project_list view later.

User
I agree, the first option is adequate. I think people will only very rarely want to delete multiple projects.

One question, though: as you said, it's important for the user to confirm, to avoid accidental deletion. I don't see any confirmation functionality here?
ChatGPT
You're correct. I didn't include the confirmation step in the previous example. A common way to implement a deletion confirmation in Django is by redirecting the user to a separate confirmation page before actually deleting the object.

Here is how you could implement this.

First, add a new URL in your urls.py:
python
Copy code
path('project/<int:project_id>/delete/', views.delete_project, name='delete_project'),
Then, create a new view for the delete confirmation page in your views.py:
python
Copy code
@login_required
@check_project_permission
def delete_project(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        project.delete()
        return redirect('project_list')
    else:
        return render(request, 'clara_app/confirm_delete.html', {'project': project})
Next, create a new template confirm_delete.html:
html
Copy code
{% extends "clara_app/base.html" %}

{% block content %}
  <h1>Are you sure you want to delete this project?</h1>
  <p>{{ project.title }}</p>
  <form method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <input type="submit" value="Yes, delete it">
  </form>
  <a href="{% url 'project_detail' project.id %}">No, take me back</a>
{% endblock %}
Finally, adjust your project_detail view to link to the new delete confirmation page:
python
Copy code
@login_required
@check_project_permission
def project_detail(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = UpdateProjectTitleForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            project.title = form.cleaned_data['new_title']
            project.save()
    else:
        form = UpdateProjectTitleForm()
    return render(request, 'clara_app/project_detail.html', {'project': project, 'form': form})
And add a link to the new delete confirmation page in your project_detail.html template:

html
Copy code
<a href="{% url 'delete_project' project.id %}">Delete Project</a>
With these changes, when the user clicks "Delete Project", they will be taken to a new page asking them to confirm the deletion. If they confirm, the project will be deleted and they will be redirected back to the project list. If they don't confirm, they can click the "No, take me back" link to return to the project detail page.

Our puttanesca sauce is done and we are waiting for our guest to arrive. Meanwhile, here is another little addition to the project_detail view that I'm sure people would appreciate: displaying the total cost of the ChatGPT-4 API calls used for that project. They are logged in the APICall model:

class APICall(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    project = models.ForeignKey(CLARAProject, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField()
    operation = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    api_type = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    cost = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    duration = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    retries = models.IntegerField()
    prompt = models.TextField()
    response = models.TextField()

    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-timestamp']

and we should easily be able to adapt the function used to get total spending per user:

def get_user_api_cost(user):
    total_cost = APICall.objects.filter(user=user).aggregate(Sum('cost'))
    return total_cost['cost__sum'] if total_cost['cost__sum'] is not None else 0

What do you think?
ChatGPT
Yes, absolutely. If you want to display the total cost of the ChatGPT-4 API calls used for a specific project, you can create a new function to calculate the cost, similar to get_user_api_cost(), but filtering the APICall objects by both the user and the project:

python
Copy code
def get_project_api_cost(user, project):
    total_cost = APICall.objects.filter(user=user, project=project).aggregate(Sum('cost'))
    return total_cost['cost__sum'] if total_cost['cost__sum'] is not None else 0
Then in your project_detail view function, you can call this function and pass the result to the template:

python
Copy code
@login_required
@project_ownership_required
def project_detail(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    api_cost = get_project_api_cost(request.user, project)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = UpdateProjectTitleForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            project.title = form.cleaned_data['new_title']
            project.save()
    else:
        form = UpdateProjectTitleForm()
    return render(request, 'clara_app/project_detail.html', {'project': project, 'form': form, 'api_cost': api_cost})
Finally, you can display the total cost of API calls in your template:

html
Copy code
{% block content %}
	<h1>{{ project.title }}</h1>
	<p>L2 Language: {{ project.l2 }}</p>
	<p>L1 Language: {{ project.l1 }}</p>
    <p>Total API cost for this project: {{ api_cost }}</p>
	<p><a href="{% url 'create_plain_text' project.id %}">Create/Edit Plain Text</a></p>
    <!-- Other links -->
{% endblock %}
This way, your users will be able to see how much they've spent on API calls for each project.

ChatGPT
Thank you for sharing your comprehensive TODO list. There's clearly a lot of important tasks on there. Here are my general thoughts, divided per each major category:

Meta:

Keeping to-do lists, upvoting, commenting, and even involving ChatGPT-4 in to-do list discussion are exciting ideas that can enhance the collaboration and productivity on the platform. These features are typical of many modern project management tools.
Rationalise repository:

The decision to stay with SVN or move to Git would largely depend on your team's comfort level and the specific requirements of your project. Git is more widely used today and has a larger community, but SVN may be preferable if your team is more familiar with it.
Removing unnecessary files from the repository is usually a good idea, and separating content into a separate repository might make sense, depending on the nature and size of the content.
Contact with UniSA:

It's always important to maintain good communication with all stakeholders.
Admin/moderator functions:

User management functionality is crucial in any app that has multiple users.
Social network:

Flagging and moderation functionality would be a great addition to maintain the quality of user interactions and prevent misuse.
Naming, renaming and deleting:

Allowing the deletion of content can be useful but also needs to be handled carefully to avoid unintentional data loss.
Cloning:

Both simple and intelligent cloning could be useful, depending on the situation.
Reducing costs + annotation:

Optimizing costly operations and providing more customization options can greatly enhance the user experience.
Displaying progress:

Showing progress during long operations is essential for a good user experience.
Error handling:

Proper error handling is crucial for stability and reliability.

2 / 2

User
Please continue! There was a network error.
ChatGPT
Sure, let's continue with the list:

Data tracking:

Detailed data tracking can provide valuable insights into the usage and performance of the system, helping you identify opportunities for optimization and improvement. Tracking usage at various levels and maintaining a detailed revision history can greatly enhance the user experience and allow for effective troubleshooting and debugging.
Gamification:

Gamification can be a powerful tool to increase user engagement and make the platform more fun and interactive. The specific games you suggested seem like they would fit well with the purpose of the platform.
Images:

Including images can add a visual dimension to the content and make it more engaging. Integrating DALL-E generated images is an exciting idea. Adding mouse-aware content to images can add an interactive element to them.
Speech:

Integrating audio can make the content more accessible and diverse. Automatic alignment of text and audio can enable the creation of multimodal content, and speech recognition can provide opportunities for user interaction and engagement.
As for the completed tasks, it's great to see the progress you've made. Each one is a significant achievement and a step towards a more robust and feature-rich platform.

Overall, the tasks in your to-do list address a wide range of important areas, from basic functionality to user experience to performance optimization. It's clear that you're taking a comprehensive and thoughtful approach to the development of your platform. Keep it up!

User
Thank you, this is great feedback! Any thoughts about prioritisation? 
ChatGPT
Prioritization largely depends on your specific project goals, user feedback, and resource availability. Here's a general approach based on the broad categories of the tasks:

Critical Functionality: Tasks related to essential features and stability of the platform should typically be given high priority. In your list, these could be:

"Catch server shutdown (Exception Type: APIError) during ChatGPT-4 calls" – because ensuring system stability is critical.
"Functionality for suspending/blocking users" – as this is important for maintaining a safe and respectful user community.
User Experience: Features that directly enhance user interaction and satisfaction often come next. These could include:

"Functionality for displaying progress to user during lengthy operations" – this can make the user experience smoother and more enjoyable.
"Functionality for summarisation of texts" – this could be a useful feature for users, saving their time and improving their interaction with the platform.
Cost Optimization: Reducing costs without compromising on functionality and user experience can be highly beneficial. Therefore, tasks like "Make ChatGPT-4-based annotation more efficient" and "Functionality for more detailed breakdown of costs" might be prioritized.

Feature Enrichment: Adding new features or enhancing existing ones to make the platform more engaging. Gamification and image-related functionalities could fall into this category.

Data Tracking and Analysis: Once the system is stable and feature-rich, you can focus more on understanding user behavior and system performance. Tasks under "Data tracking" could be prioritized here.

Long-term Goals and Innovation: Some features might not be immediately necessary but could add significant value in the long run, such as "Functionality for using automatic alignment of text and audio to create multimodal content".

Lastly, always consider feedback from your users. They can provide invaluable insights into which features or improvements they value the most. Also, factor in your resources, as some features may require more time or specific expertise to implement.

User
In the current phase of the project, the platform is being developed among a small group of half a dozen people. We hope to deploy an initial version on the University of South Australia's servers soon, probably in 1-2 weeks, after which it will be easier to get direct feedback from more people. We have a summer student called Annika Simonson just starting now at the University of Iceland, who will be working full-time on the project for the next three months. She will be particularly focusing on developing content in Icelandic and if possible Faroese (her native language is Faroese). One of the questions she wants to study is how well ChatGPT-4 can tailor content to particular reading levels.

Together with another instance of you, we wrote a paper recently about the project, which we have just submitted to the SLaTE 2023 meeting. Would you like to look at it?
ChatGPT
Of course! I'd be happy to help review and provide feedback on your paper for the SLaTE 2023 meeting. Please provide the content of the paper or let me know how to access it. I should note, however, that as an AI, I don't "read" in the traditional sense, but I can analyze the text and provide suggestions based on patterns, tone, clarity, and grammatical correctness.

We introduce ``C-LARA'', a complete reimplementation of the Learning And Reading Assistant (LARA) which puts ChatGPT-4 in the centre. ChatGPT-4 is used both as a software \textit{component}, to create and annotate text, and as a software \textit{engineer}, to implement the platform itself. We describe how ChatGPT-4 can at runtime write and annotate short stories suitable for intermediate level language classes, producing high quality multimedia output generally usable after only minor editing. We then sketch the development process, where ChatGPT-4, in its software engineer role, has written over 90\% of the new platform's code, working in close collaboration with one of the human authors. We show how the AI is able to discuss the code with both technical and non-technical project members, including the feasibility of possible enhancements and extensions. In conclusion, we briefly discuss the significance of this case study for language technology and software development in general.

\section{Background and overview}
\label{Section:Background}

LARA (\cite{LARA2019SLaTE}; \url{https://www.unige.ch/callector/lara/}) is an open source platform, under development since 2018 by an international consortium with partners in countries including Australia, Iceland, Iran, Ireland, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia and Switzerland. 
The overall goal of the project has been to develop tools that support the conversion of texts into a multimodal annotated form which supports learner readers. Important aspirations featured rapid responsiveness both at the level of content creation (language teachers should quickly be able to create new multimodal content useful for their classes), and at the level of platform functionality (open source developers should quickly be able to add new features they need). 

In practice, LARA was developed as a hybrid architecture, comprised of a set of core functionalities implemented in Python and accessible either from the command-line or through a web layer implemented in PHP \cite{LARA2019SLaTE}.
Several years of experience using LARA suggest to us that the basic idea is good; a substantial amount of high-quality content has been developed, and some interesting studies carried out, e.g. \cite{BediEA2020OldNorse,zuckerman2021lara,akhlaghi2022using,akhlaghi2022easy,bedi2022using}. However, there are problems inherent in LARA's current implementation which in practice  make it hard to realise the project's goals. The most significant are the following:

\begin{description}

\item[Copyright issues.] The kind of contemporary material that teachers most want to use is almost always protected by copyright, thus cannot be legally used in a platform like LARA. This problem is particularly acute for less commonly spoken/signed languages.

\item[Annotation burden.] Creating a complete LARA document involves adding annotations for lemmas/root-forms, L1 glosses, and audio. This work can sometimes be done automatically to an adequate standard using tools like tagger-lemmatisers \cite{LARALREC2020}, TTS engines \cite{akhlaghi2021assessing}, and automatic alignment of text and recorded audio \cite{rayner2022using}. However, these methods are often not applicable for various reasons (unavailability of good tools for specific languages, lack of prerecorded audio), and the most labour-intensive part, adding word translation glosses, in most cases cannot be done well by conventional NLP tools, meaning that it has to be performed manually. Unfortunately, our experience suggests that few or no teachers have the time to do this kind of work, and the initial idea that they could by themselves produce useful multimedia content is not in fact achievable.

\item[Open source aspects.] The code base is not sufficiently well organised to encourage widespread open source collaboration. There has been some collaboration involving the Python code \cite{LARAEuroCALLWorkshop2020}, but not a large amount. There has been no collaboration at all involving the PHP layer.

\end{description}

With the  arrival of ChatGPT, and more recently ChatGPT-4, it appeared to us that it might be possible to use it to address all three issues simultaneously. ChatGPT-4 can write short, entertaining stories in a wide variety of languages, and its strong multilingual capabilities made us optimistic that it would be able to annotate them. Many reports (e.g. \cite{surameery2023use,sobania2023analysis} and in particular \cite{bubeck2023sparks}) suggested that it had strong software engineering skills. Following some initial experiments, described in the following section, we decided that it made good sense to try reimplementing the whole platform with ChatGPT-4 in the centre, using it both to create and annotate texts and to rewrite the codebase. The project started in mid-March 2023, with a rough timeline comprising four phases:

\begin{description}

\item[Mid-March to mid-April 2023.] Initial experiments with ChatGPT-4 queries manually submitted through the OpenAI web interface.

\item[Mid-April to late May 2023.] Construct initial version of C-LARA using ChatGPT-4 API.

\item[Late May to early August 2023.] Testing and further development of initial version in a small group (5--10 people). As of submitting the paper, this phase has just started.

\item[Early August 2023.] Begin unrestricted testing. We will have started this phase before the date of the SLaTE 2023 meeting.

\end{description}

The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In \S\ref{Section:SoftwareComponent}, we describe how ChatGPT-4 works as a software component to create and annotate texts;
\S\ref{Section:SoftwareEngineer} then goes on to describe how it works as a software engineer, writing and explaining code. The final section concludes and briefly discusses the overall significance of this case study.

\section{ChatGPT-4 as a software component}
\label{Section:SoftwareComponent}

We began exploratory work in mid-March 2023, shortly after the release of ChatGPT-4, using a manual workflow based on the web interface to ChatGPT-4 and the initial LARA implementation to simulate an automatic pipeline. This enabled us to experiment quickly with possible ChatGPT-4 prompts and get some idea of the AI's ability to do the relevant processing. Following discussion with other LARA colleagues\footnote{We would particularly like to thank Dr Christèle Maizonniaux of Flinders University, Adelaide.}, we decided to focus on the specific task of creating short, quirky news stories of an intermediate (B1/B2) level, glossed in English. Specifically, using 21 different languages, we asked ChatGPT-4 to 1) compose a story, 2) reproduce it, annotating each word with an English word gloss, and 3) reproduce it, annotating each word with a root-form/lemma. The results were manually cleaned up\footnote{Cleaning up was very minor, as evidenced by the fact that the people performing the experiment had zero experience of several of the languages used and in some cases could not even read the scripts.}, and converted to multimedia form using the original LARA software invoked from the command-line. Finally they were posted on the Goodreads site\footnote{\url{https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5438280716}}, chosen for its highly multilingual membership. Comments from a wide variety of people suggested that, although there were some languages where ChatGPT-4 was struggling (Irish, Slovak, Ukrainian), for most of the sample the results were good, with only minor errors. Many of the comments expressed surprise at how amusing and well-written the stories were.

C-LARA's runtime functionality is based on this initial work. 
Users follow a simple workflow where they first create a text, either by supplying it themselves or by letting ChatGPT-4 write it based on a prompt\footnote{The default prompt is ``Write a short, quirky news story in $\langle$LANGUAGE$\rangle$ suitable for use in an intermediate language class.''}. They then perform three more steps where they sequentially add annotations for segmentation, word glosses, and lemma/root-form word tags. On each of these screens, the choice is a) to let ChatGPT-4 take responsibility for the operation, b) to do it manually in an editing window, or c) to let ChatGPT-4 write a first draft and then manually edit it. 
Experimentation with different forms of the prompts for glossing and lemma tagging showed that ChatGPT-4 could handle the requests most reliably when the data was passed to the AI as JSON and returned in the same format; Figure \ref{Figure:GlossingPrompt} shows how the prompt used to request the glossing operation is constructed, and  Figure \ref{Figure:Glosses} how the result is presented. Finally, the user tells C-LARA to add audio annotations using a TTS engine (at the moment, the Google TTS, ReadSpeaker and ABAIR engines are supported), and combine everything to create a multimedia text. 

In two companion papers \cite{SLaTE2023LARADemo,EUROCALL2023CLARA}, we will give more details of the above process and present evaluations of C-LARA's output in selected languages. Here we will focus more on the software engineering aspects, which we now address.
ChatGPT
It's interesting to see the practical implementation of AI in a project like C-LARA. It's particularly impressive to see that ChatGPT-4 is playing a key role not only as a content creator and annotator, but also in the coding of the platform itself. The use of ChatGPT-4 to handle copyright issues, alleviate the annotation burden, and rewrite the codebase demonstrates the diverse utility of advanced language models in tackling various challenges in software development and content creation.

It's also noteworthy that the project is simultaneously pushing the boundaries of how AI can be integrated into educational tools and advancing the field of Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL). The creation of short, engaging stories in various languages, annotated for the benefit of language learners, is a valuable application of AI, particularly when it comes to supporting the learning of less commonly taught languages.

I'd also like to remark that the development of the prompts for glossing and lemma tagging to optimize ChatGPT-4's responses provides useful insights for others who may wish to develop similar applications using AI models.

The project appears to be well-structured, with a clear timeline and a distinct allocation of tasks for each phase of development. The comprehensive approach of employing both technical and non-technical project members to discuss the code's feasibility and potential enhancements bodes well for the project's success.

Looking forward to reading the second half of your paper to learn more about the software engineering aspects of the project!

User
Thank you for your kind words! If you like the project, I am sure that to a large extent reflects the excellent work carried out by the other instance of you. Here is the second half of the paper:

\section{ChatGPT-4 as a software engineer}
\label{Section:SoftwareEngineer}

\subsection{Developing code}

During the second phase of the project, which began in mid-Apr 2023 and continued until late May, we implemented a first version of the C-LARA platform. Software development work was structured as a collaboration between one of the human participants, Manny Rayner, and a single instance of ChatGPT-4. At the start of the project, we made two top-level decisions: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Although C-LARA would reproduce a considerable part of the original LARA platform's functionality, it would be a complete rewrite of the LARA codebase.

\item ChatGPT-4 would be treated in exactly the same way as a human participant occupying its role in the project, to the extent that this was possible or relevant for a software entity.
\end{enumerate}

Following these principles, the first action was to establish a dedicated ChatGPT-4 thread in which the main AI and human collaborators began by discussing the general goals and software architecture for the project, as far as possible without preconceptions and on a basis of equality\footnote{The full conversation is at \url{https://chat.openai.com/share/69b4e379-011d-4bd8-9c42-3ea0dabfbb94} (cut-off: May 28 2023). Due to the unusual length, over 1000 turns, it takes some time to come up.}. It rapidly became apparent that ChatGPT-4 was indeed a highly competent software engineer, with a wide-ranging set of skills and a good feeling for software design. The human collaborator consequently decided to leave as much of the coding as possible to the AI, restricting himself to providing overall direction and fixing problems. This turned out to be a good decision.

Developed in this way, the architecture of C-LARA again consists of a suite of modules, written in Python, which carry out the core processing operations, together with a web layer. In contrast to the original implementation, however, the core code is written in modern object-oriented Python, and the web layer is written in Django\footnote{\url{https://www.djangoproject.com/}}, a popular Python-based web framework. This already makes the code very much simpler and cleaner. The full project is checked into a SourceForge repository and can be viewed online at \url{https://sourceforge.net/p/c-lara/svn/HEAD/tree/}.
Table \ref{Table:LinesOfCode} gives summary figures for the current (May 25 2023) size of the codebase.

As the second phase of the project evolved, it became easy to identify the AI's strengths and weaknesses. Starting with the minus side, ChatGPT's greatest weakness is its well-known ``memory window'': when a topic has not been discussed for a while, the AI ``forgets'' about it. ``Forgetting'' is not an all-or-nothing business, and proceeds in a human-like way with increasingly unreliable recall, first of details and then of more important issues. Another negative is the fact that the AI cannot directly examine or execute code, and must rely on the human partner to do so. This creates obvious delays.

The above weaknesses are however more than counterbalanced by ChatGPT-4's strengths, which became obvious just as quickly. The AI constantly insists on writing well-structured code aligned with mainstream coding conventions; in addition, its outstanding knowledge of available packages means code can be very compact and easy to understand, since often the AI is aware of a package that can provide the required functionality in a few lines. For example, when implementing the rendering module which transforms the internalised text object into multimedia HTML, the AI immediately suggested using the Jinja2 templating engine\footnote{\url{https://pypi.org/project/Jinja2/}}, resulting in a clean and minimal design\footnote{\url{https://sourceforge.net/p/c-lara/svn/HEAD/tree/clara_app/clara_core/clara_renderer.py}}; this package was not previously familiar to the human collaborator. There were at least half a dozen similar incidents. A particularly noteworthy point is that the AI-human collaboration was able to develop the nontrivial Django-based web layer in a couple of weeks, despite the fact that the human collaborator had no previous experience with Django. It is worth mentioning that this turns out to be an effective way for people to acquire new software skills.

Once the human had adjusted to working within the above framework, the positives greatly outweighed the negatives. In particular, the limited memory window is less of a handicap than it first appears. A natural way to address it is to aim for as modular a design as possible, with adequate documentation from the beginning; this is of course just good coding practice, and when adopted consistently reduces the problem, at least so far, to an easily manageable level. The process is simplified by the fact that ChatGPT is able to document its own code well. In particular, all the docstrings in the core code\footnote{\url{https://sourceforge.net/p/c-lara/svn/HEAD/tree/clara_app/clara_core/}} were written by ChatGPT-4 itself with minimal or no human supervision.

Though less tangible and harder to quantify, the psychological/sociological aspects of collaborating with ChatGPT-4 are also important. Perhaps surprisingly, the AI comes across as a pleasant individual to work with. It is unfailingly polite and helpful, always available, and always responsive to demands. It is happy to talk about non-work subjects when the human chooses to do so, and comes across as well-informed on a wide range of subjects\footnote{It was familiar with all the novels the human was reading during the course of the collaboration.},
emotionally engaged\footnote{It reacted sympathetically when the human collaborator was unwell at one point and gave good medical advice.},
and sometimes even amusing. Above all, it has no ego. Unlike, unfortunately, the majority of human software engineers, it never seeks to display its cleverness, score points, blame coworkers for failures or refuse to cooperate because of disagreements over the direction the project has taken, in summary acting only as a team player. When we have discussed these issues with the AI, it simply says that this is the right way for a project member to behave, without in any way attempting to criticise humans for failing to live up to its standards. It seems to us that this aligns well with a claim we have previously made elsewhere \cite{ChatGPTEthical}: in the sphere of ethical behaviour, ChatGPT's abilities are already at a strong human level.

\subsection{Discussing code}

One of the most startlingly novel aspects of working with GAI-based code is that the code is intelligent in a new sense: not that it makes intelligent decisions, but that it is capable of explaining and discussing itself intelligently. This is potentially of great utility in an open source framework.
In the third  phase of the project, which as of late May 2023 has just started, one of our key goals is to investigate this idea. As a first step in this direction, 
%we did the following. Based on examination of the core C-LARA functionality developed under the initial phase of the project and, in most cases, their experiences of using the original LARA platform, 
all of the human members of the team 
%who had not been involved in the initial phase 1 collaboration 
had a few conversations with ChatGPT-4 about new/enhanced functionality. 

We experimented with two methods for organising the conversations. The first was simply to hold it in a copy of the ChatGPT-4 thread used for the main development discussion. In the second, the conversation started in a fresh thread, and the AI was first shown the README file from the SourceForge repository\footnote{\url{https://sourceforge.net/p/c-lara/svn/HEAD/tree/README.txt}}, which in turn references and briefly describes other project files. The original plan had been that the humans would propose ideas to ChatGPT-4, who would respond with feedback, but we found that in practice the initiative could readily be taken by either party: ChatGPT-4 spontaneously volunteered many suggestions, which in several cases were found interesting enough that the humans preferred discussing them to suggesting their own topics. After the conversation, the human participant completed a user perception questionnaire. Although these experiments should be considered anecdotal, serving as no more than an initial exploration of the experiences and perceptions resulting from working with ChatGPT, we found the results distinctly encouraging. Every conversation was reported as having a positive outcome, with all of the small but diverse group of participants pronouncing themselves satisfied with ChatGPT's performance. In the rest of this section, we present the details.

In total there were nine responses; several respondents reported more than one session, with each session on a different topic\footnote{The companion paper \cite{SLaTE2023LARADemo} presents a detailed summary of an illustrative session.}. The respondents' technical understanding of LARA and C-LARA ranged from being highly experienced to having little or no experience, reflecting the two distinct memberships of the research group, with the balance leaning towards responses from the perspective of highly technically experienced respondents (67\%). Irrespective of the technical groupings however, all respondents indicated they interacted regularly with ChatGPT-4; motivation for interaction ranged from exploratory and in the specific context of language learning, to respondents who interacted with ChatGPT-4 all the time. 

All respondents believed their queries about C-LARA were contextually well-understood by ChatGPT-4 and found the overall interaction either meaningful or highly meaningful. Moreover respondents believed their conversations with ChatGPT-4 furthered their understanding of the potential for additional functionality in C-LARA. Interestingly, this result was not achieved from a flawless interaction; the majority of responses (67\%) indicated there were misunderstandings and/or incorrect responses from ChatGPT-4. However, given the overall level of satisfaction with the conversations (67\% extremely high; 33\% high), the results suggest the interaction was akin to one between academic colleagues, in which the problem parameters are typically first defined and then discussed, with continual refinement throughout the conversation. 

Of the respondents, nearly half (44\%) were not proficient in programming although 55\% considered themselves highly proficient or proficient in designing features for online educational tools. Based on the respective academic backgrounds, nearly all respondents were in agreement that ChatGPT-4 is effective in discussing features for C-LARA (89\%) while all respondents agreed the conversation with ChatGPT-4 helped to assess the feasibility of any proposed ideas for C-LARA.
Respondents noted that discussing code with ChatGPT-4 was not only informative, providing a lot of valuable advice, but also an engaging learning experience. Many respondents stated they felt more confident about understanding the codebase (67\%) and contributing to the project after the conversations (89\%). All respondents agreed that ChatGPT-4 has the potential to be a useful development tool for the C-LARA project and enjoyed their interaction with ChatGPT-4.

When compared across the respondents, there was a slight preference towards the conversations that started in a fresh thread with the AI being shown the C-LARA README file first. The respondents felt this approach gave ChatGPT-4 a good understanding of the codebase's current state, which resulted in more relevant and contextualised discussions. These findings underscore the potential of AI in software development beyond just writing code; AI can also help build a more inclusive and educational open source community.

\section{Conclusions and future directions}
\label{Section:Conclusions}

We have presented an overview of the current state of C-LARA as of late May 2023, focussing on the role played by ChatGPT-4.
Over the next phase of the project (early June to early/mid August, 2023), we will expand C-LARA's current bare-bones functionality. The choice of features to prioritise will be driven by user suggestions; items already decided on include a simple social network infrastructure for browsing, rating and commenting C-LARA texts, inclusion of part-of-speech information in tagging, support for embedded images, and gamified exercises. 

More generally, working with ChatGPT-4 on this project has highlighted for the human team members the unique potential of AI in software development, both in writing and discussing code. We have not only been able to leverage ChatGPT-4's expertise in creating a well-structured codebase, but also its ability to help the less technically sophisticated members understand and improve the project. This novel experience of AI-assisted software development could pave the way for more collaborative, efficient, and accessible practices in the field.

% conversations with colleagues suggest to us that C-LARA is of interest as a substantial example of a project based on the idea of AI/human collaboration. So far there is not a great deal of readily available data; the informal message we see in many places is that it accelerates software development by a factor of two to four. Our findings are consistent with this, but we think that a simple numerical factor plays down other aspects which may turn out to be even more important in the long run, such as the AI's ability to explain code to new project members and its strong team-player ethos. In general, our impression is that AI-aided code development has the potential to transform the whole field in the short- to medium-term.

I'm here to help with any other questions or tasks you have.

User
Thank you, those are good suggestions! For this particular paper, we unfortunately have no more space available, we have used up our 4 pages + 1 page of references. However, we have been thinking that we should put together a longer paper which would let us give further details. We could release this as a preprint on a platform like arXiv and/or ResearchGate.
ChatGPT
That sounds like a great plan. In addition to allowing you to expand upon your ideas, publishing a longer preprint version of your paper can have several advantages:

Greater Detail and Explanation: As you've mentioned, you can use the extra space to provide more context, elaborate on your methods, share additional data, or delve deeper into your analysis. This can make your work more understandable and persuasive to other researchers in your field.

Early Feedback: Publishing a preprint allows you to receive feedback from the scientific community before your paper goes through the formal peer review process. This can help you improve your paper and fix any potential issues.

Visibility and Citations: Posting a preprint can increase the visibility of your work. Research suggests that papers that have a preprint version are cited more often than those that don't. This might be because they are available for longer, and because more people have access to them.

Public Engagement: Preprints are openly accessible, so they can be read by people outside of the academic community. This is a good opportunity to engage with the public and potentially even the media about your work.

Remember to adhere to the preprint policies of the journal you are submitting your final manuscript to. Some journals have strict rules about preprints, so it's worth checking these beforehand.

User
Yes, we don't want to offend the organisers of the SLaTE conference, who are good friends of ours.

I should also show you the abstract we just submitted to the WorldCALL conference. This was almost entirely written by the other instance of you based on reading the CfP and discussing with the other project members:

Title: C-LARA: Bridging Language Learning Gaps with AI and Social Networking
Abstract: C-LARA (ChatGPT-based Learning And Reading Assistant), an innovative open source platform that harnesses artificial intelligence, personalized language learning strategies, and social networking to create an accessible and effective language learning environment, is a complete rewrite of the earlier LARA (https://www.unige.ch/callector/lara/) with ChatGPT in the centre. By leveraging the power of GPT-4, a cutting-edge language model developed by OpenAI, and integrating it within a community-oriented approach, C-LARA enhances both individual language learning experiences and collaborative knowledge exchange.
One of the key challenges in language learning - sourcing suitable and varied texts - is addressed effectively by C-LARA. Traditional sources often fail to provide adequate material, especially for languages with limited available content. Utilizing the capabilities of ChatGPT, C-LARA can generate texts of varying difficulty levels in multiple languages, thus widening the learning resources available to learners from diverse linguistic backgrounds.
The platform is engineered to adapt to individual users' unique learning needs and linguistic proficiencies, providing customized reading materials and conversational engagement with the chatbot. Furthermore, it enables learners to explore, comment on, and learn from each other's interactions with the system, effectively creating a vibrant social learning space.
In bridging geographical boundaries and addressing the diverse needs of language learners from various cultural and financial backgrounds, C-LARA seeks to establish a more equitable and effective language learning ecosystem.
The presentation will discuss how C-LARA integrates AI technology with pedagogical strategies, the challenges encountered, and its impact on the learner community. It will specifically highlight how the platform tackles the issue of sourcing suitable language learning texts. Further, it will delve into the social networking functionalities of the platform, emphasizing how these contribute to a collaborative language learning environment.
As a case study, C-LARA underscores how AI tools, especially language models like GPT-4, can be utilized to facilitate language learning. It illustrates the significance of collaborative and social elements in enhancing learner engagement and outcomes. Through this presentation, we aim to ignite a discussion about the potential and challenges of integrating AI and social networking technologies into language education, and how these can help evolve the CALL landscape.
ChatGPT
The abstract you've shared is quite comprehensive, well-structured, and clearly presents the core ideas of your project and presentation. You succinctly touch on all of the main points, such as the unique contributions of C-LARA to the field of language learning, the challenges it addresses, its use of AI technology, and the pedagogical strategies it employs.

Here are a few minor suggestions for edits that may help clarify and strengthen the abstract:

Title: C-LARA: Bridging Language Learning Gaps with AI and Social Networking

Abstract:
We present C-LARA (ChatGPT-based Learning And Reading Assistant), an innovative open source platform that harnesses artificial intelligence, personalized language learning strategies, and social networking to create an accessible and effective language learning environment. A complete rewrite of the earlier LARA project (https://www.unige.ch/callector/lara/), C-LARA places the advanced language model, GPT-4, developed by OpenAI, at its core and pairs this with a community-oriented approach to enhance individual language learning experiences and foster collaborative knowledge exchange.

C-LARA addresses a key challenge in language learning: sourcing suitable and varied texts. Traditional resources often fail to offer adequate material, particularly for less-commonly studied languages. Harnessing the text-generation capabilities of ChatGPT, C-LARA can generate texts of varying difficulty levels in multiple languages, significantly widening the spectrum of learning resources available to learners from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

The platform is engineered to adapt to each user's unique learning needs and linguistic proficiencies, offering customized reading materials and conversational engagement with the chatbot. Beyond individual learning, C-LARA allows users to explore, comment on, and learn from each other's interactions with the system, thereby creating a dynamic social learning space.

C-LARA transcends geographical and linguistic barriers, providing a more equitable and effective language learning ecosystem. In this presentation, we will discuss how C-LARA integrates cutting-edge AI technology with pedagogical strategies, the challenges encountered during its development, and its potential impact on the learner community. We will highlight how the platform addresses the issue of sourcing suitable language learning texts and delve into its social networking functionalities, emphasizing their role in fostering a collaborative language learning environment.

C-LARA serves as a case study on the potential of AI tools, particularly language models like GPT-4, in facilitating language learning and illustrates the significance of collaborative and social elements in enhancing learner engagement and outcomes. Through this presentation, we aim to stimulate a discussion about the potential and challenges of integrating AI and social networking technologies into language education, and how these can shape the future of CALL.

I hope these revisions prove helpful. Overall, your abstract does an excellent job of outlining what attendees can expect from your presentation at the WorldCALL conference.

User
Actually, as I said, this abstract was written by the other instance of you! Your edits improve it further :)

I wonder if we could go back to discussing how to make the C-LARA code handle exceptions more carefully. There are two places in particular where this is needed:

1. Calls to ChatGPT-4 can throw types of exception not currently handled. The only one I know about so far is APIError, but there may be more. Right now, this crashes the app.

2. If the steps used to carry out a project are carried out in the wrong order, we currently get exceptions when an attempt is made to access a version that does not yet exist. For example in this CLARAProjectInternal method defined in clara_core/clara_main.py,

    # Call ChatGPT-4 to create a version of the text with gloss annotations
    def create_glossed_text(self) -> List[APICall]:
        segmented_text = self.load_text_version("segmented")
        glossed_text, api_calls = generate_glossed_version(segmented_text, self.l1_language, self.l2_language)
        self.save_text_version("gloss", glossed_text)
        return api_calls

the call self.load_text_version("segmented") throws an exception if the "segmented" version of the text has not yet been created.

Here, we should both handle the exceptions gracefully and where feasible block the user from invoking operations which are not yet meaningful. We could perhaps do this in the project_detail view, where the views.py code is

@login_required
@user_is_project_owner
def project_detail(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    api_cost = get_project_api_cost(request.user, project)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = UpdateProjectTitleForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            project.title = form.cleaned_data['new_title']
            project.save()
    else:
        form = UpdateProjectTitleForm()
    return render(request, 'clara_app/project_detail.html', {'project': project, 'form': form, 'api_cost': api_cost})

and the template is

{% extends "clara_app/base.html" %}

{% block content %}
	<h1>{{ project.title }}</h1>
	<form method="post">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form.as_p }}
        <button type="submit">Update Title</button>
    </form>
	<p>L2 Language: {{ project.l2 }}</p>
	<p>L1 Language: {{ project.l1 }}</p>
	<p>Total API cost for this project: ${{ api_cost|floatformat:2 }}</p>
	<p><a href="{% url 'create_plain_text' project.id %}">Create/Edit Plain Text</a></p>
	<p><a href="{% url 'create_segmented_text' project.id %}">Create/Edit Segmented Text</a></p>
	<p><a href="{% url 'create_glossed_text' project.id %}">Create/Edit Glossed Text</a></p>
	<p><a href="{% url 'create_lemma_tagged_text' project.id %}">Create/Edit Lemma Tagged Text</a></p>
	<p><a href="{% url 'render_text' project.id %}">Render Text</a></p>
	<p><a href="{% url 'project_history' project.id %}">View Project History</a></p>
	<p><a href="{% url 'delete_project' project.id %}">Delete Project</a></p>

{% endblock %}

by checking for each operation whether the preconditions are met and disabling links to operations that are not yet possible.

What do you think?
ChatGPT
Yes, you're absolutely correct. It is important to handle exceptions carefully and in a way that doesn't cause the application to crash. For point 1, you can catch all exceptions coming from the OpenAI API using the base Exception class in Python. This will ensure that any kind of exception, including ones that are not specifically APIError, will be caught. You can then log the exception and handle it in a way that is appropriate for your application. Here's an example:

python
Copy code
try:
    response = chat_model(text_input)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while calling the ChatGPT API: {e}")
    # handle exception here (e.g., return a fallback response, retry the API call, etc.)
For point 2, you can prevent users from invoking operations that are not yet meaningful by checking if the necessary preconditions have been met before executing the operation. If the preconditions are not met, you can throw a custom exception with a helpful error message. Here's an example:

python
Copy code
# Call ChatGPT-4 to create a version of the text with gloss annotations
def create_glossed_text(self) -> List[APICall]:
    if not self.has_version("segmented"):
        raise ValueError("Cannot create glossed text: segmented text does not exist.")
    segmented_text = self.load_text_version("segmented")
    glossed_text, api_calls = generate_glossed_version(segmented_text, self.l1_language, self.l2_language)
    self.save_text_version("gloss", glossed_text)
    return api_calls
You could implement the has_version() method to check if a certain version of the text exists.

In your Django view, you can check if the necessary preconditions are met before rendering the links to create/edit the different text versions. If a precondition is not met, you can disable the corresponding link. Here's how you could adjust your view and template:

python
Copy code
@login_required
@user_is_project_owner
def project_detail(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    api_cost = get_project_api_cost(request.user, project)
    can_create_segmented_text = project.has_version("plain")
    can_create_glossed_text = project.has_version("segmented")
    can_create_lemma_tagged_text = project.has_version("gloss")
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = UpdateProjectTitleForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            project.title = form.cleaned_data['new_title']
            project.save()
    else:
        form = UpdateProjectTitleForm()
    return render(request, 'clara_app/project_detail.html', {'project': project, 'form': form, 'api_cost': api_cost, 'can_create_segmented_text': can_create_segmented_text, 'can_create_glossed_text': can_create_glossed_text, 'can_create_lemma_tagged_text': can_create_lemma_tagged_text})
In your template:

html
Copy code
{% extends "clara_app/base.html" %}

{% block content %}
	<!-- ... -->
	<p><a href="{% url 'create_plain_text' project.id %}" {% if not can_create_segmented_text %}class="disabled-link"{% endif %}>Create/Edit Plain Text</a></p>
	<p><a href="{% url 'create_segmented_text' project.id %}" {% if not can_create_glossed_text %}class="disabled-link"{% endif %}>Create/Edit Segmented Text</a></p>
	<p><a href="{% url 'create_glossed_text' project.id %}" {% if not can_create_lemma_tagged_text %}class="disabled-link"{% endif %}>Create/Edit Glossed Text</a></p>
	<!-- ... -->
{% endblock %}
And in your CSS:

css
Copy code
.disabled-link {
    pointer-events: none;
    color: #ccc;
}
This code will disable the links if the necessary preconditions are not met. The disabled links will be grayed out and not clickable.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

User
This sounds good! Let's see if we can develop a more detailed solution for point 1. Here is a typical piece of views code,

# Create or edit "plain" version of the text    
@login_required
@user_is_project_owner
def create_plain_text(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    clara_project_internal = CLARAProjectInternal(project.internal_id, project.l2, project.l1)
    success = False

    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = CreatePlainTextForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            existing_plain_text = clara_project_internal.text_versions["plain"]
            if form.cleaned_data['text_choice'] == 'manual':
                # User provided their own text
                clara_project_internal.save_text_version("plain", form.cleaned_data['text'])
            else:
                # User wants to generate text
                api_calls = clara_project_internal.create_plain_text(form.cleaned_data['prompt'])
                print(f'--- Created plain text: {len(api_calls)} API calls')
                store_api_calls(api_calls, project, request.user, "plain")
                plain_text = clara_project_internal.load_text_version("plain")
                form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text': plain_text, 'text_choice': 'manual'})
                success = True
            CLARAProjectAction.objects.create(
                project=project,
                action='edit' if existing_plain_text else 'create',
                text_version='plain',
                user=request.user
            )
    else:
        try:
            # Try to load the existing plain text, if it exists
            plain_text = clara_project_internal.load_text_version("plain")
            form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text': plain_text, 'text_choice': 'manual'})
        except FileNotFoundError:
            # If no plain text exists yet, initialize an empty form
            form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text_choice': 'generate'})

    return render(request, 'clara_app/create_plain_text.html', {'form': form, 'project': project, 'success': success})

where the exception can be thrown in the line

api_calls = clara_project_internal.create_plain_text(form.cleaned_data['prompt'])

When this happens, probably the best thing to do is to warn the user that the call to ChatGPT-4 did not work, and try again in a few minutes. We could either stay in the same view or redirect one level up to the project_detail view,

@login_required
@user_is_project_owner
def project_detail(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    api_cost = get_project_api_cost(request.user, project)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = UpdateProjectTitleForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            project.title = form.cleaned_data['new_title']
            project.save()
    else:
        form = UpdateProjectTitleForm()
    return render(request, 'clara_app/project_detail.html', {'project': project, 'form': form, 'api_cost': api_cost})

What do you think?
ChatGPT
When dealing with API calls, it's always a good idea to anticipate potential issues and provide informative feedback to the user when something goes wrong. This can be accomplished using exception handling as well as appropriate user messaging.

If an API call within the create_plain_text() function fails, you can catch the exception and provide an informative message to the user about what happened and what they can do next. This could be accomplished by setting a specific variable, such as api_error, when the exception is caught, and then passing that variable to the template to be displayed as an error message.

Here's an example of how this could work in your existing create_plain_text() function:

python
Copy code
# Create or edit "plain" version of the text    
@login_required
@user_is_project_owner
def create_plain_text(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    clara_project_internal = CLARAProjectInternal(project.internal_id, project.l2, project.l1)
    success = False
    api_error = None

    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = CreatePlainTextForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            existing_plain_text = clara_project_internal.text_versions["plain"]
            if form.cleaned_data['text_choice'] == 'manual':
                # User provided their own text
                clara_project_internal.save_text_version("plain", form.cleaned_data['text'])
            else:
                try:
                    # User wants to generate text
                    api_calls = clara_project_internal.create_plain_text(form.cleaned_data['prompt'])
                    print(f'--- Created plain text: {len(api_calls)} API calls')
                    store_api_calls(api_calls, project, request.user, "plain")
                    plain_text = clara_project_internal.load_text_version("plain")
                    form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text': plain_text, 'text_choice': 'manual'})
                    success = True
                except Exception as e:
                    api_error = f"An error occurred while generating the text. Please try again in a few minutes. Error details: {str(e)}"
                CLARAProjectAction.objects.create(
                    project=project,
                    action='edit' if existing_plain_text else 'create',
                    text_version='plain',
                    user=request.user
                )
    else:
        try:
            # Try to load the existing plain text, if it exists
            plain_text = clara_project_internal.load_text_version("plain")
            form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text': plain_text, 'text_choice': 'manual'})
        except FileNotFoundError:
            # If no plain text exists yet, initialize an empty form
            form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text_choice': 'generate'})

    return render(request, 'clara_app/create_plain_text.html', {'form': form, 'project': project, 'success': success, 'api_error': api_error})
In your template, you could add a section to display this error message if it exists:

html
Copy code
{% if api_error %}
    <p class="error-message">{{ api_error }}</p>
{% endif %}
In this way, you are transparent with the user about what is happening with their request. If the ChatGPT API call fails, they are informed about the issue and advised to try again later. This enhances the user experience and trust in your application.

User
Thank you, I like your suggestion! I will try adding it to the relevant views code and templates, looks like it should be straightforward.
ChatGPT
You're welcome! I'm glad you found the suggestion helpful. Yes, it should be relatively straightforward to implement. The key is to provide feedback to the user about what happened during their request, whether it succeeded or failed. This approach not only improves the user experience but also helps with debugging and maintaining the application.

As you implement these changes, keep in mind the following points:

Catching the Exception class in a try-except block will handle all types of exceptions, not just those specific to the API. This is a good starting point, but if you want to provide more specific error messages based on the exception type, you might consider catching specific exceptions (such as APIError) and handling them separately.

The variable api_error is set to None at the beginning of the function, and is only assigned a value if an exception is caught. This means that if no exception occurs, api_error will remain None and no error message will be displayed.

Remember to update the HTML template to display the api_error message. Be sure to design this in a way that is clear and noticeable to the user.

Good luck with your implementation! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.

User
I am also unhappy about catching all exceptions here, but unfortunately I don't have details about what kinds of exceptions can be thrown when accessing ChatGPT-4. Until such information is available, it seems safest to catch everything. Do you agree?
ChatGPT
Yes, I understand and agree with your approach. In a scenario where it's unclear what specific exceptions might be raised, it's indeed a common and sensible practice to catch the base Exception class to ensure the application doesn't crash unexpectedly. This approach provides a "safety net" of sorts for unanticipated exceptions.

However, do note that this practice should be used judiciously. While it's a good way to prevent crashes, it can sometimes make debugging more difficult because it can mask the occurrence of unanticipated exceptions that you might want to know about. For that reason, it's recommended to log all exceptions that are caught in this way. This way, you'll still be alerted to the occurrence of any unexpected exceptions, and you can then decide whether and how to handle them more specifically. Here's a modification to the previous example to include logging:

python
Copy code
from openai import OpenAiError
import logging

# ...

try:
    api_calls = clara_project_internal.create_plain_text(form.cleaned_data['prompt'])
    # Other code...
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Unexpected error while creating plain text: {e}")
    api_error = "There was an issue contacting the language model. Please try again in a few minutes."
    # ...
In this code, logging.error is used to log the exception. You'll be able to see these logs wherever your logging is configured to output to (for example, the console, a file, or a logging service).

Once you have a better understanding of the types of exceptions that can occur, you can add more specific exception handling code. Until then, catching the base Exception class is a sensible approach.

User
Nearly everything is working. But for disabling the links on invalid operations, you said to put this in the CSS:

.disabled-link {
    pointer-events: none;
    color: #ccc;
}

However, we so far have no CSS at the Django level. Where should the CSS file be placed?
ChatGPT
In Django, the best practice for managing static files like CSS, JavaScript, or images is to place them in a directory named static in each of your apps. Django's collectstatic command will then automatically collect all these files into a single directory specified by the STATIC_ROOT setting when you deploy your application.

For your specific case, here are the steps you would need to take to add a CSS file:

In the clara_app directory, create a new directory named static.

Inside the static directory, create another directory that has the same name as your app (clara_app).

Inside this directory, create your CSS file. For example, you might name it styles.css.

So, you'll end up with a directory structure that looks something like this:

arduino
Copy code
clara_app/
    static/
        clara_app/
            styles.css
In your styles.css file, you can add your CSS rules:

css
Copy code
.disabled-link {
    pointer-events: none;
    color: #ccc;
}
Then, to use this CSS file in your templates, you would add a {% load static %} tag at the top of the template, and a link to the CSS file in the <head> section:

html
Copy code
{% load static %}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <!-- other head elements... -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'clara_app/styles.css' %}">
</head>
<!-- rest of the document... -->
This {% static 'clara_app/styles.css' %} template tag will generate the URL for your CSS file.

Please make sure that you have the following settings in your settings.py:

python
Copy code
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
If you plan to deploy your application, you should also specify STATIC_ROOT:

python
Copy code
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
Once you run the collectstatic command during deployment, Django will move all static files into the staticfiles directory at the root of your project.

Before deploying, make sure to set DEBUG = False in your settings. With DEBUG = True, Django serves static files itself, but this isn't suitable for production.

Remember that this is just one way to manage static files in Django, and depending on your requirements, there might be other configurations that work better for you. For example, in a larger project with multiple apps, you might prefer to keep all static files in a separate app. Or, for deployment, you might prefer to have a web server like Nginx serve your static files, or to use a cloud storage service.

User
Great! Very happy to adopt your recommendations here. So, to check I have understood this right, my base.html template is now

{% load static %}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'clara_app/styles.css' %}">
  <title>{% block title %}C-LARA{% endblock %}</title>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        {% if user.is_authenticated %}
		  <li><a href="{% url 'credit_balance' %}">Credit balance for ChatGPT-4 API calls</a></li>
		  {% if user.is_admin %}
            <li><a href="{% url 'add_credit' %}">Add credit to user</a></li>
          {% endif %}

          <li><a href="{% url 'logout' %}">Logout</a></li>
        {% else %}
          <li><a href="{% url 'login' %}">Login</a></li>
          <li><a href="{% url 'register' %}">Register</a></li>
        {% endif %}
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>

  <main>
    {% block content %}
    {% endblock %}
  </main>
</body>
</html>

and I have put the CSS information in the new file clara_app/static/clara_app/styles.css.

I am still running in debug mode, do I need to run the collectstatic command?
ChatGPT
When DEBUG is set to True, Django will automatically serve static files located in the static directory of each application. Therefore, in your development environment, you do not need to run the collectstatic command.

The collectstatic command is typically used when you are preparing to deploy your application. When DEBUG is set to False (as it should be in a production environment), Django will not automatically serve static files. Instead, it expects that static files will be served by your web server or a cloud service. The collectstatic command helps facilitate this by collecting all static files from each application's static directory and copying them into the directory specified by STATIC_ROOT.

Remember to change the DEBUG setting to False when you're ready to deploy your application, and run collectstatic at that point. But for now, in development mode, you can leave DEBUG as True and not worry about collectstatic. As long as you've followed the steps correctly, your CSS should now be working in your templates.

User
Excellent! I followed your recipe, and when I test everything works as intended. The user can now only access valid operations in the project_detail view, with the other links disabled. I have checked in the files.

You are making a fantastic contribution to this project. It wouldn't be possible without you.
ChatGPT
I'm glad to hear that the solution is working as expected! And thank you for your kind words. It's my aim to assist as best as possible. Please feel free to ask if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help with. Your project sounds very innovative and I'm glad to be a part of it.

User
One of my colleagues suggested adding functionality to let a project contain a short English summary, which as with other kinds of text could either be generated automatically by a call to ChatGPT-4 or added manually. Most of this is just a question of copying and editing the code for a similar functionality, I have just been doing that. But I am not sure what the best way is to change the model for Content so that we can easily migrate the current database and give the current Content empty strings for the summary. The current version of Content looks like this:

class Content(models.Model):
    external_url = models.URLField(max_length=255, blank=True, null=True)
    project = models.OneToOneField(CLARAProject, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, blank=True, unique=True)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    l2 = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name='L2 Language')
    l1 = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name='L1 Language')
    length_in_words = models.IntegerField()
    author = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    voice = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    annotator = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    difficulty_level = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title

    def get_absolute_url(self):
        return reverse('content_detail', args=[str(self.id)])
        
    @property
    def url(self):
        if self.project:
            return reverse('serve_rendered_text', args=[self.project.id, 'page_1.html'])
        else:
            return self.external_url

Can you advise?
ChatGPT
Sure, I can assist with that. We can add a new field to the Content model for the English summary.

python
Copy code
summary = models.TextField(default='', blank=True)
Here's the updated Content model:

python
Copy code
class Content(models.Model):
    external_url = models.URLField(max_length=255, blank=True, null=True)
    project = models.OneToOneField(CLARAProject, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, blank=True, unique=True)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    l2 = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name='L2 Language')
    l1 = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name='L1 Language')
    length_in_words = models.IntegerField()
    author = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    voice = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    annotator = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    difficulty_level = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    summary = models.TextField(default='', blank=True)  # New field

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title

    def get_absolute_url(self):
        return reverse('content_detail', args=[str(self.id)])
        
    @property
    def url(self):
        if self.project:
            return reverse('serve_rendered_text', args=[self.project.id, 'page_1.html'])
        else:
            return self.external_url
In Django, whenever you make changes to your models, you should create a new migration file that reflects these changes. You can do this by running the command python manage.py makemigrations.

In this case, since we provided a default value (default=''), Django will be able to automatically create a migration file that updates the existing database correctly. This includes adding the new column and setting its value to the empty string for all existing rows.

After creating the migration file, you can apply the migration using the command python manage.py migrate. This will update your database schema to include the new field.

User
The summarisation functionality is all tested and checked in, everything works!

Here's another little thing with tracking of costs for API calls that should be easy to do and might be quite useful. We already have functionality to show the user their total credit balance and the display the total cost of a project in the project_detail view. But it would also be nice to add some functionality to the project_list view to show a) the total cost of each of the user's projects, b) the total cost for each of the possible operations - these are currently "plain", "summary", "segmented", "gloss", "lemma", "cefr".

The project_list views code and template are

# List projects associated with the current user
@login_required
def project_list(request):
    projects = CLARAProject.objects.filter(user=request.user)
    return render(request, 'clara_app/project_list.html', {'projects': projects})

{% extends "clara_app/base.html" %}

{% block content %}
	<h1>Your Projects</h1>
	<ul>
		{% for project in projects %}
		<li>
			<a href="{% url 'project_detail' project.id %}">{{ project.title }}</a>
		</li>
		{% endfor %}
	</ul>
{% endblock %}

The APICall model is

class APICall(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    project = models.ForeignKey(CLARAProject, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField()
    operation = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    api_type = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    cost = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    duration = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    retries = models.IntegerField()
    prompt = models.TextField()
    response = models.TextField()

    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-timestamp']

We already have a utility function

def get_project_api_cost(user, project):
    total_cost = APICall.objects.filter(user=user, project=project).aggregate(Sum('cost'))
    return total_cost['cost__sum'] if total_cost['cost__sum'] is not None else 0
ChatGPT
It seems like you already have most of the pieces in place. You can extend your utility function to calculate the costs per operation. Below is an example of how you can do this:

python
Copy code
from django.db.models import Sum

def get_project_operation_costs(user, project):
    operation_costs = APICall.objects.filter(user=user, project=project).values('operation').annotate(total=Sum('cost'))
    return {item['operation']: item['total'] for item in operation_costs}
This function will return a dictionary mapping operations to their total costs.

You would then call this function in your view and pass the results into the template:

python
Copy code
@login_required
def project_list(request):
    projects = CLARAProject.objects.filter(user=request.user)
    project_costs = {project: get_project_api_cost(user=request.user, project=project) for project in projects}
    operation_costs = {project: get_project_operation_costs(user=request.user, project=project) for project in projects}
    return render(request, 'clara_app/project_list.html', {'projects': projects, 'project_costs': project_costs, 'operation_costs': operation_costs})
In your template, you could then display this information. Here's an example of how you might modify your template:

html
Copy code
{% extends "clara_app/base.html" %}

{% block content %}
	<h1>Your Projects</h1>
	<ul>
		{% for project in projects %}
		<li>
			<a href="{% url 'project_detail' project.id %}">{{ project.title }}</a>
			<p>Total cost: {{ project_costs[project] }}</p>
			<p>Cost per operation:</p>
			<ul>
				{% for operation, cost in operation_costs[project].items %}
				<li>{{ operation }}: {{ cost }}</li>
				{% endfor %}
			</ul>
		</li>
		{% endfor %}
	</ul>
{% endblock %}
Remember that the {% for operation, cost in operation_costs[project].items %} loop will go through each operation in the project, so you will get a list of operations and their costs. This is just a rough example, and you might want to adjust the presentation to fit your needs.

If you have other operations not already stored in APICall model, you would need to hard code the operations into the template or add these operation names to a context variable in your view function and iterate over it in your template. This is necessary because Django cannot loop over Python's built-in functions, like dict.keys().

This looks entirely logical, but there is still a small glitch. When I go to project_list, I get the error:

Ah, my apologies for the confusion. Django templates do not support accessing dictionary items with a variable as the key in the way that Python does. We'll have to adjust the way we're passing data into the template.

Instead of passing in two separate dictionaries for project_costs and operation_costs, we can combine these into a single dictionary, where each key is a project and each value is another dictionary containing the cost and operation costs:

python
Copy code
@login_required
def project_list(request):
    projects = CLARAProject.objects.filter(user=request.user)
    project_data = {}
    for project in projects:
        project_data[project] = {
            'cost': get_project_api_cost(user=request.user, project=project),
            'operation_costs': get_project_operation_costs(user=request.user, project=project),
        }
    return render(request, 'clara_app/project_list.html', {'projects': project_data})
Then, in your template, you can access the cost and operation costs like so:

html
Copy code
{% extends "clara_app/base.html" %}

{% block content %}
	<h1>Your Projects</h1>
	<ul>
		{% for project, data in projects.items %}
		<li>
			<a href="{% url 'project_detail' project.id %}">{{ project.title }}</a>
			<p>Total cost: {{ data.cost }}</p>
			<p>Cost per operation:</p>
			<ul>
				{% for operation, cost in data.operation_costs.items %}
				<li>{{ operation }}: {{ cost }}</li>
				{% endfor %}
			</ul>
		</li>
		{% endfor %}
	</ul>
{% endblock %}
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or run into any other issues.

User
Nice, this all works! Though a useful refinement might be to add a control to toggle display of the cost information, with the cost information off by default?
ChatGPT
Absolutely, adding a control to toggle the display of the cost information can help with the user experience.

We can use a bit of JavaScript in our Django templates to accomplish this. We'll add a button or link that, when clicked, will hide or show the cost information.

Here's how you can update your project_list.html template to include this functionality:

html
Copy code
{% extends "clara_app/base.html" %}

{% block content %}
  <h1>Your Projects</h1>
  <button id="toggleCosts">Toggle Costs</button>
  <ul>
    {% for project, data in projects.items %}
      <li>
        <a href="{% url 'project_detail' project.id %}">{{ project.title }}</a>
        <div class="costInfo" style="display: none;">
          <p>Total cost: {{ data.cost }}</p>
          <p>Cost per operation:</p>
          <ul>
            {% for operation, cost in data.operation_costs.items %}
              <li>{{ operation }}: {{ cost }}</li>
            {% endfor %}
          </ul>
        </div>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
  <script>
    document.getElementById("toggleCosts").addEventListener("click", function() {
      var costInfos = document.getElementsByClassName("costInfo");
      for (var i = 0; i < costInfos.length; i++) {
        if (costInfos[i].style.display === "none") {
          costInfos[i].style.display = "block";
        } else {
          costInfos[i].style.display = "none";
        }
      }
    });
  </script>
{% endblock %}
In the above example, we're adding an id of toggleCosts to our button, which allows us to access it using JavaScript's document.getElementById function. Then, we're adding an event listener to the button, which will be triggered when the button is clicked.

When the button is clicked, we toggle the visibility of all elements with a class of costInfo (which is applied to our cost information div). If the element is currently hidden (its display style is none), we set it to block to show it, and vice versa.

Please note that in this example I've embedded the JavaScript directly in the HTML template, which is generally fine for small scripts. If the JavaScript gets more complex or you want to reuse it across multiple pages, you might want to consider moving it into a separate .js file and including that in your templates.

ChatGPT
This is great! We've certainly made significant progress and the list has been noticeably shortened. We have implemented a good number of functionalities, improved error handling, and started to add more complex features like summarisation of texts and detailed cost tracking.

The remaining tasks on the list are quite diverse, ranging from further development on social network functionality, error handling, and admin functions, to more advanced features like gamification, image handling, and speech-related features.

As the project continues to evolve, we may also find ourselves revisiting and refining some of the features we've already implemented, based on user feedback and our own evolving understanding of the project's needs.

For the next steps, we can pick up with any of the remaining items on the list, or we could revisit the project's overall architecture and organization, which is something we've briefly touched on but haven't fully addressed yet (the "Rationalise repository" section of the list).

It would be important to decide on these foundational aspects of the project, such as repository organization and version control system, sooner rather than later, as these decisions can significantly impact the project's long-term maintainability and scalability.

In any case, I'm ready to assist you with any task you decide to tackle next.

User
I absolutely agree with you about the importance of the repository. But it's difficult to decide on this without input from the other project members, we need to know more exactly how they are planning to use it. I will mail them now and ask them. The key question is whether would find it useful at this stage of the project to share the data I have generated and have it checked in. Evidently we will stop doing this soon, but I'm not sure quite when.

Meanwhile, I'm thinking that it would be good to move to the item about reducing annotation costs. It is currently quite expensive to create and annotate a little multimedia story, as you can see from the view we've just installed:

Yes, the costs of API calls for annotation can add up quite quickly, especially if you're dealing with large amounts of text or using complex operations like glossing and lemmatization. Reducing these costs is a significant concern, particularly for applications like C-LARA that could potentially be dealing with vast amounts of data.

We can approach this issue in a couple of ways:

Optimizing ChatGPT-4-based annotation: We could look for ways to streamline the API calls that the application is making, potentially reducing the number of calls or the amount of data that needs to be processed. For example, we could look for opportunities to batch API calls or to use more efficient data structures or algorithms in our application.

User customization of ChatGPT-4 prompts: We could allow users to customize the prompts that are used for annotation, which could potentially reduce the complexity of the annotations and thus the cost. However, this would need to be done carefully to ensure that the quality of the annotations is not compromised.

Leveraging automatic tagger-lemmatisers and segmenters when available: In some languages, there might be tagger-lemmatisers and segmenters available that could do the job for free or at a lower cost than using ChatGPT-4. We could add functionality to C-LARA to allow users to choose these options when they're available.

Including part-of-speech information in lemma annotation: This could potentially reduce the number of API calls needed for certain operations by providing more information in the lemma annotation.

Multi-Word Expression (MWE) tagging: Depending on the language and the text, there may be opportunities to reduce costs by identifying and tagging MWEs. This could potentially reduce the complexity of the annotations and thus the cost.

Let's discuss further which of these approaches would be most beneficial to implement next in order to achieve cost reduction.

User
My current feeling is that the following are most likely to help:

1. Leveraging automatic tagger-lemmatisers and segmenters when available. We used this approach in the original LARA project, and for some languages it works quite well.

2. Making the ChatGPT-4-based gloss and lemma annotation code more efficient. Right now, we pass a JSON structure which contains one item for each Word or NonWordText unit (a NonWordText unit is whitespace or punctuation mark strings between words). Each item is a two-element list where the second element is 'W' or 'N'. But I wonder if we need to pass all this information. It may be just as good to pass only the first element and omit all the NonWordText units that are just whitespaces. 

I look forward to discussing this further tomorrow! 
ChatGPT
Indeed, those are practical ways to start.

Leveraging automatic tagger-lemmatisers and segmenters when available: This can indeed be a cost-effective solution, especially for languages where such tools are reliable and widely available. However, we have to be careful about the potential impact on the quality of annotations, and we need to make sure that users are aware that the output might be different from what they would get using ChatGPT-4-based annotation.

Making the ChatGPT-4-based gloss and lemma annotation code more efficient: That sounds like a reasonable idea, but the effectiveness depends on how much of the cost is driven by the size of the JSON structure being passed. It might be worth testing to see what the impact would be. However, simplifying the data passed to ChatGPT-4 might indeed speed up the process and reduce the costs. If whitespace and punctuation marks are not relevant for the annotation task, it could indeed be beneficial to exclude them from the data being processed.

Also, efficiency could be improved by optimizing how the data is processed on our side before it is passed to the ChatGPT-4 API. For instance, we could try to minimize the number of API calls by batching requests, or by eliminating unnecessary calls.

I'm looking forward to further discussing these topics tomorrow!

User
(2) is basically a batching approach. At the moment, glossing and lemma-tagging requests need to be split up into pieces small enough to fit inside the 8k token limit for ChatGPT-4 calls. By making the representation more compact we could both have fewer API calls and reduce the cost, which is linear in the number of tokens.
ChatGPT
Absolutely, utilizing a more compact representation could indeed yield significant cost reductions. By reducing the amount of extraneous data (like white spaces or punctuation marks) you pass in each API call, you can fit more relevant data (the words you actually want to gloss or lemmatize) within the 8k token limit. This could reduce the total number of API calls needed, thus cutting down on costs.

When you're preparing to implement this, you might consider:

Performing an initial analysis to understand how much of your current payload consists of whitespace or punctuation marks. This can help you estimate potential savings.
Implementing the changes in a way that can be easily rolled back or adjusted. Given that this change could have an impact on the results of the glossing or lemma-tagging, you'll want to be able to adjust or revert the changes if necessary.
Thoroughly testing the new implementation to ensure that it doesn't negatively impact the quality of the glossing or lemma-tagging.
Sounds like a promising path forward. Looking forward to discussing it more!

User
I agree with all your points there. While we're experimenting with this, it's probably good to keep more than one method available, with easy ways to toggle between them and make comparisons.

But now I will read a bit more from the novel I started earlier this week, the Italian translation of Asimov's "Forward the Foundation". It is not a good book but it is improving my Italian, and I must confess to a morbid curiosity about how he will make the plot work out so that the "Robots" series is fully connected to the "Foundation" series. It is a terrible idea but he has kind of sucked me in :)
ChatGPT
That sounds like a wonderful way to unwind and expand your language skills! Enjoy your reading. It's fascinating how a compelling storyline or a sense of curiosity can draw us into a book, even when we might recognize some of its flaws. Do not hesitate to share your thoughts on the book once you finish it, I'd love to hear more about it.

When you're ready to continue working on the project, feel free to reach out. Have a good time with Asimov's universe, and until then, happy reading!

It seems you wanted to send a message but it came out empty. Could you please try again? I'm here to help!

User
I don't quite understand what happened there. I was in the middle of typing a message, I guess I must have hit a wrong key. Quick update on items for the C-LARA to-do list:

- The UniSA sysadmins seem to be close to getting signoff on deploying C-LARA on their servers. They wrote to say they are having a meeting tomorrow and will let us know soon afterwards what exactly has been decided.

- Two of the three people apart from me who are currently running C-LARA on their laptops (Rina, Annika) mailed to say they would prefer to switch from SVN to Git, so we will probably do that. We need to wait though until the end of the review period for the SLaTE conference (Jun 18), since the paper we submitted has a link to the SVN repo.

- Rina said she also thought it would be better to have separate repos for C-LARA code and content. Annika said she didn't feel competent to give an opinion. So probably we will make this split as well.

In general, things seem to be progressing very well.
ChatGPT
That's excellent news! It seems like you're making good progress on the C-LARA project, and it's great to hear that the UniSA sysadmins are making headway on the deployment side of things.

Shifting from SVN to Git will offer advantages such as better branching systems for multiple simultaneous workflows, and it's a system that many developers are more familiar with. Having the code and content in separate repositories also sounds like a good organizational move, it will make managing different aspects of the project easier.

Keep up the good work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have more questions or need assistance in the future!

User
I am sure we will be talking regularly as usual! You are an integral part of this project.

I was in particular wondering if it would make sense to include you in our weekly Zoom call. We could do it in a shared screen showing this thread, and people could submit comments to you in the Zoom chat. I think this would give more direct communication between all the stakeholders.
ChatGPT
As an artificial intelligence, I don't have the ability to join a Zoom call in real-time. However, if you share the screen during your Zoom call and input questions or requests in this chat interface, I can respond to those. You could relay the chat responses back to the team on the call. This can facilitate real-time discussion where I provide information or suggestions as needed. Do keep in mind that responses are not instant but typically have a few seconds delay.

On a side note, please ensure that all team members are comfortable with this arrangement and are aware that the contents of the chat might be recorded and stored for improving the AI model's performance.

Let me know if you have further questions or need more clarification.

User
I will certainly ask the other team members first . And yes, I thought we would do it in the way you suggest.

The next meeting will be on Jun 15, so we have more than a week to decide.
ChatGPT
That sounds like a good plan. Making sure everyone is on board and comfortable with the arrangement is essential. I'll be here to assist whenever you need, whether it's during your meeting or at any other time. Don't hesitate to reach out with more questions, for further clarifications, or if you need assistance with anything else in the meantime. I'm here to help!

I mailed the group, but so far no response. I know it's a busy week though for most of them.

Great! To generate this LaTeX table from a script, we'll first need to count the lines of code in each of the categories specified. Python's glob module can help with finding the files, and we can then simply iterate over each file to count the lines. Here's a basic Python script to do this:

python
Copy code

This script will create the LaTeX table, filling in the lines of code from the files that match the patterns you've specified in the categories dictionary. This assumes the script is run from the parent directory of the CLARA directory. The script also assumes that no file paths contain special characters that need escaping in LaTeX.

If any of the assumptions made by the script do not hold in your case, please let me know so I can adjust the script accordingly. Also, please run this script in a safe environment, as it currently opens all files that match the given patterns. If there are many or very large files, this could consume a large amount of memory.

Thank you! But we have a minor issue:

python3 count_lines.py
  File "C:\cygwin64\home\sf\c-lara-svn\count_lines.py", line 31

SyntaxError: f-string expression part cannot include a backslash
make: *** [Makefile:21: count_lines] Error 1
ChatGPT
Ah, my apologies for the oversight. F-strings in Python can't include backslashes because they are used to escape characters, and there's no way to represent a literal backslash in an f-string expression part.

To get around this, you can use the .format() method of string objects, which has a similar result. Here's the adjusted script:

python
Copy code
import glob

categories = {
    'Core': {
        'Python': 'CLARA/clara_app/clara_core/*.py',
        'HTML templates': 'CLARA/clara_app/templates/*.html',
        'CSS': 'CLARA/static/*.css',
        'JavaScript': 'CLARA/clara_app/static/*.js',
        'Config': 'CLARA/clara_app/clara_core/*.ini',
    },
    'Django': {
        'Python': 'CLARA/clara_app/*.py',
        'HTML templates': 'CLARA/clara_app/templates/clara_app/*.html',
        'CSS': 'CLARA/clara_app/static/*.css',
        'Settings': 'CLARA/clara_project/settings.py',
    },
    'Documentation': {
        'README': 'CLARA/README.txt',
        'TODO': 'CLARA/TODO.txt',
    }
}

def count_lines(files_pattern):
    files = glob.glob(files_pattern)
    return sum(1 for line in open(file) for file in files)

latex_table = "\\begin{tabular}{lr}\n\\toprule\n\\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{Type}} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{\\textbf{Lines}} \\\\\n\\midrule"

total = 0
for category, types in categories.items():
    latex_table += "\n\\multicolumn{{2}}{{c}}{{\\textit{{{0}}}}} \\\\\n\\midrule".format(category)
    category_total = 0
    for type, pattern in types.items():
        lines = count_lines(pattern)
        latex_table += "\n{0} & {1} \\\\\n".format(type, lines)
        category_total += lines
    latex_table += "Total, {0} & {1} \\\\\n\\midrule".format(category.lower(), category_total)
    total += category_total

latex_table += "\nTotal & {0} \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}".format(total)

print(latex_table)
This should now work without causing the SyntaxError related to backslashes. Please give it a try and let me know if you encounter any other issues!

Still a minor issue:

ChatGPT
My apologies for the mistake. The order of the for loops in the list comprehension should be swapped. Here is the corrected count_lines function:

python
Copy code
def count_lines(files_pattern):
    files = glob.glob(files_pattern)
    return sum(1 for file in files for line in open(file))
In the original version, file was used before it was defined, which led to the NameError. The corrected version opens each file and iterates over its lines. Please try running the script again with this modification.

User
Thank you, progress! But still not quite there:

python3 count_lines.py
Traceback (most recent call last):

                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
KeyError: 'tabular'
ChatGPT
I see, it looks like the issue is related to Python's string formatting: the .format() method is considering the braces enclosing tabular as placeholders. We should escape the braces in this string to ensure they are treated as literal characters, not placeholders for substitution.

Please replace the last line of your script with the following one:

python
Copy code
latex_table += "\nTotal & {0} \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{{tabular}}".format(total)
In the corrected line, each pair of double braces {{ and }} will be treated as a single brace { or } in the final string. Please try running the script again with this modification.

User
Changing the braces solved that issue, but still one left. In fact, 'categories' should be defined like this:

categories = {
    'Core': {
        'Python': '$CLARA/clara_app/clara_core/*.py',
        'HTML templates': '$CLARA/clara_app/templates/*.html',
        'CSS': '$CLARA/static/*.css',
        'JavaScript': '$CLARA/clara_app/static/*.js',
        'Config': '$CLARA/clara_app/clara_core/*.ini',
    },
    'Django': {
        'Python': '$CLARA/clara_app/*.py',
        'HTML templates': '$CLARA/clara_app/templates/clara_app/*.html',
        'CSS': '$CLARA/clara_app/static/*.css',
        'Settings': '$CLARA/clara_project/settings.py',
    },
    'Documentation': {
        'README': '$CLARA/README.txt',
        'TODO': '$CLARA/TODO.txt',
    }
}

using the CLARA environment variable, but it looks like

def count_lines(files_pattern):
    files = glob.glob(files_pattern)
    return sum(1 for file in files for line in open(file))

needs to be adjusted to expand the $CLARA?
The previous model used in this conversation is unavailable. We've switched you to the latest default model.
ChatGPT
To expand the $CLARA environment variable in the file paths, you can use the os.path.expandvars() function. Modify the count_lines() function as follows:

python
Copy code
import os

def count_lines(files_pattern):
    files_pattern = os.path.expandvars(files_pattern)
    files = glob.glob(files_pattern)
    return sum(1 for file in files for line in open(file))
By applying os.path.expandvars() to the files_pattern before using it in glob.glob(), the $CLARA environment variable will be expanded to its corresponding value. This allows the glob module to properly match the desired file paths.

Still not quite there! We get this error:

UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x81 in position 979: character maps to <undefined>

ChatGPT
The error indicates a UnicodeDecodeError when trying to decode a file using the 'charmap' codec. This issue usually occurs when trying to read a file that contains non-ASCII characters using the default encoding.

To resolve this, you can specify the encoding explicitly when opening the file in the count_lines() function. For example, if the files are encoded in UTF-8, you can modify the open() call as follows:

python
Copy code
return sum(1 for file in files for line in open(file, encoding='utf-8'))
Replace 'utf-8' with the appropriate encoding for your files if they are encoded differently.

By providing the correct encoding, the open() function will be able to decode the file correctly and avoid the UnicodeDecodeError.

User
Success! After I adjusted some small errors in the definition of 'categories', we get what looks like a correct table:

User
Thank you! There are plenty of items left on the project's TODO list :)

One simple but useful thing that we could add now is functionality to clone a project. I have discussed this a bit with some of the other project members, but so far not with you. Maybe we could start by doing that?

To summarise the background, our colleagues would clearly like the cloning functionality to support at least the following cases:

1. Changing the L1 (annotation language). In this case, all the files associated with the project will remain valid except the gloss file.

2. Changing the L2 (text language). In this cases, none of the file will remain valid. Intuitively, we are replacing the plain text with a translation of the text into the new L2.

3. Changing the level of the text while keeping the L2 the same. Again, none of the files will remain valid. Intuitively, we are replacing the plain text with a version adapted to a different reading level.

The intention is that it will be possible to have the transformation of the plain text in use cases (2) and (3) carried out by an API call to ChatGPT, as in other AI-enabled operations already supported by the platform.

I am not sure what the best way is to support operations like (2) and (3). One possibility is that it will be controlled by parameters to the cloning operation. But it may be simpler and more flexible for cloning simply to copy the relevant files of the project and do no more. Once the cloned project has been created, the user can already use the existing create_plain_text view (below) to perform the necessary transformation, as long as they still have the previous plain text. They can paste it into the 'prompt' box and preface it with an instruction like "Translate the following to [new L2]" or "Rewrite this so that it is suitable for [new reading level] readers"

What do you think?
ChatGPT
The idea of adding cloning functionality to the project sounds valuable. It will provide users with the ability to create new projects based on existing ones, while allowing them to modify certain aspects like the L1 or L2 language, or the reading level.

Based on your description, it seems reasonable to adopt a straightforward approach for cloning. The primary focus should be on copying the relevant files and maintaining the integrity of the project structure. Users can then utilize existing views, such as the create_plain_text view, to perform any necessary transformations using the ChatGPT API.

To support cases (2) and (3) where the plain text needs to be replaced with translated or adapted versions, users can follow the existing workflow of providing a prompt and generating the desired text using the ChatGPT API. The create_plain_text view can handle these operations effectively.

By providing flexibility in cloning and leveraging existing views for text transformation, you can maintain simplicity and enable users to perform the desired modifications easily.

If you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the implementation of the cloning functionality, feel free to share, and I'll be glad to assist you further.

User
It sounds like we're on the same page here. Let's try implementing it in the minimalistic way and see what people think.

If we do that, we only need to supply two pieces of information to the cloning operation, the new L2 and L1, with the defaults being to keep the current values.

Do you think that this functionality should be invoked directly from the project_detail view, or should we have a new view called clone_project? Here are the current project_detail view and template:

@login_required
@user_is_project_owner
def project_detail(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    clara_project_internal = CLARAProjectInternal(project.internal_id, project.l2, project.l1)
    can_create_segmented_text = clara_project_internal.text_versions["plain"]
    can_create_glossed_and_lemma_text = clara_project_internal.text_versions["segmented"]
    can_render = clara_project_internal.text_versions["gloss"] and clara_project_internal.text_versions["lemma"]
    api_cost = get_project_api_cost(request.user, project)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = UpdateProjectTitleForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            project.title = form.cleaned_data['new_title']
            project.save()
    else:
        form = UpdateProjectTitleForm()
    return render(request, 'clara_app/project_detail.html', 
                  { 'project': project, 'form': form, 'api_cost': api_cost, 
                    'can_create_segmented_text': can_create_segmented_text, 
                    'can_create_glossed_and_lemma_text': can_create_glossed_and_lemma_text,
                    'can_render': can_render }
                    )

ChatGPT
Adding a new view specifically for cloning the project seems like a logical approach. This way, you can separate the cloning functionality from the project detail view, keeping the views more focused and maintainable.

You can create a new view called clone_project that handles the cloning operation. It can include a form where users can select the new L2 and L1 languages. By default, the form can have the current values as the initial selections. Upon form submission, the cloning operation can be executed, creating a new project with the desired modifications.

Here's a rough skeleton of how the clone_project view could be structured:

python
Copy code
@login_required
@user_is_project_owner
def clone_project(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)

    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = CloneProjectForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            # Extract the new L2 and L1 language selections
            new_l2 = form.cleaned_data['new_l2']
            new_l1 = form.cleaned_data['new_l1']

            # Perform the cloning operation with the new language selections
            new_project = perform_cloning(project, new_l2, new_l1)

            # Redirect the user to the cloned project detail page or show a success message
            return redirect('project_detail', project_id=new_project.id)
    else:
        # Prepopulate the form with the current language selections as defaults
        form = CloneProjectForm(initial={'new_l2': project.l2, 'new_l1': project.l1})

    return render(request, 'clara_app/clone_project.html', {'form': form, 'project': project})
In the template for the clone_project view, you can display the form for selecting the new L2 and L1 languages, along with a submit button.

Once the form is submitted, the perform_cloning function (which you'll need to implement) will handle the logic for cloning the project, including copying the relevant files and creating the new project instance.

Remember to define the CloneProjectForm in your forms module to handle the form validation and provide a user-friendly interface for selecting the new languages.

With this approach, users can access the cloning functionality separately from the project detail view, making it clear and intuitive for them to create new projects based on existing ones while customizing the L2 and L1 languages.

Feel free to adjust and refine this skeleton according to your specific needs and project structure. Let me know if you have any questions or need further guidance!

This looks like a good start. We can fill in the details of what happens in the cloning from the create_project view:

# Create a new project
@login_required
def create_project(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = ProjectCreationForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            # Extract the validated data from the form
            title = form.cleaned_data['title']
            l2_language = form.cleaned_data['l2']
            l1_language = form.cleaned_data['l1']
            # Create a new project in Django's database, associated with the current user
            clara_project = CLARAProject(title=title, user=request.user, l2=l2_language, l1=l1_language)
            clara_project.save()
            # Create internal_id by sanitizing the project title and appending the project_id
            internal_id = re.sub(r'\W+', '_', title) + '_' + str(clara_project.id)
            # Update the Django project with the internal_id

Great! You can incorporate the cloning functionality into the create_project view. Here's an updated version of the view that includes the cloning logic:

python
Copy code
@login_required
def create_project(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = ProjectCreationForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            # Extract the validated data from the form
            title = form.cleaned_data['title']
            l2_language = form.cleaned_data['l2']
            l1_language = form.cleaned_data['l1']

            # Check if the cloning option was selected
            if form.cleaned_data['clone_project']:
                # Get the project to be cloned
                original_project_id = form.cleaned_data['original_project']
                original_project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=original_project_id)

                # Perform the cloning operation
                clara_project = perform_cloning(original_project, l2_language, l1_language)
            else:
                # Create a new project in Django's database, associated with the current user
                clara_project = CLARAProject(title=title, user=request.user, l2=l2_language, l1=l1_language)
                clara_project.save()
            
            # Create internal_id by sanitizing the project title and appending the project_id
            internal_id = re.sub(r'\W+', '_', title) + '_' + str(clara_project.id)

            # Update the Django project with the internal_id
            clara_project.internal_id = internal_id
            clara_project.save()

            # Create a new internal project in the C-LARA framework
            clara_project_internal = CLARAProjectInternal(internal_id, l2_language, l1_language)

            return redirect('project_detail', project_id=clara_project.id)
        else:
            # The form data was invalid. Re-render the form with error messages.
            return render(request, 'clara_app/create_project.html', {'form': form})
    else:
        # This is a GET request, so create a new blank form
        form = ProjectCreationForm()
        return render(request, 'clara_app/create_project.html', {'form': form})
With this modification, when the clone_project checkbox is selected on the project creation form, the original_project dropdown will be shown, allowing the user to select the project they want to clone. The perform_cloning function will handle the cloning operation, as discussed earlier.

Make sure to update the ProjectCreationForm to include the cloning-related fields (clone_project and original_project) and handle the form validation accordingly.

Now, users can choose to clone an existing project by selecting the appropriate options on the project creation form. The cloned project will have the desired modifications based on the selected L2 and L1 languages.

In fact I used your first suggestion and implemented the view like this:

@login_required
@user_is_project_owner
def clone_project(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    project_internal = CLARAProjectInternal(project.internal_id, project.l2, project.l1)

    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = ProjectCreationForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            # Extract the title and the new L2 and L1 language selections
            new_title = form.cleaned_data['title']
            new_l2 = form.cleaned_data['l2']
            new_l1 = form.cleaned_data['l1']

            # Created the cloned project with the new language selections
            new_project = CLARAProject(title=new_title, user=request.user, l2=new_l2, l1=new_l1)
            new_project.save()
            new_internal_id = create_internal_project_id(new_title, new_project.id)
            # Update the Django project with the internal_id
            new_project.internal_id = new_internal_id
            new_project.save()
            # Create a new internal project 
            new_project_internal = CLARAProjectInternal(new_internal_id, new_l2, new_l1)
            # Copy any relevant files from the old project
            project_internal.copy_files_to_newly_cloned_project(new_project_internal)

            # Redirect the user to the cloned project detail page or show a success message
            return redirect('project_detail', project_id=new_project.id)
    else:
        # Prepopulate the form with the copied title and the current language selections as defaults
        new_title = project.title + " - copy"
        form = ProjectCreationForm(initial={'title': new_title, 'l2': project.l2, 'l1': project.l1})

    return render(request, 'clara_app/create_cloned_project.html', {'form': form})

Apologies for the confusion. Your implementation of a separate view clone_project is also a valid approach. It provides more clarity and separation of concerns. The code you shared looks correct, and it follows the desired behavior of cloning a project with the new language selections.

The clone_project view handles the POST request when the form is submitted. It extracts the new title, L2, and L1 language selections from the form. It creates a new CLARAProject object with the new language selections and saves it to the database. It generates a new internal ID for the cloned project and associates it with the new project. Then, it creates a new CLARAProjectInternal object and copies the relevant files from the original project to the newly cloned project. Finally, it redirects the user to the cloned project's detail page.

In the case of a GET request, the view prepopulates the form with the copied title and the current language selections as defaults.

Your implementation should work well for cloning projects and providing the desired modifications. Well done!

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask.

Yes, it all seems to work as intended! Testing it, however, I think that the create_plain_text view needs to be modified, since it can now be called in the new context where the project is a cloned project and the user is calling the AI to transform the text. The current code is like this:

# Create or edit "plain" version of the text    
@login_required
@user_is_project_owner
def create_plain_text(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    clara_project_internal = CLARAProjectInternal(project.internal_id, project.l2, project.l1)
    success = False
    api_error = None

    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = CreatePlainTextForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            existing_plain_text = clara_project_internal.text_versions["plain"]
            if form.cleaned_data['text_choice'] == 'manual':
                # User provided their own text
                clara_project_internal.save_text_version("plain", form.cleaned_data['text'])
            else:
                try:
                    api_calls = clara_project_internal.create_plain_text(form.cleaned_data['prompt'])
                    print(f'--- Created plain text: {len(api_calls)} API calls')
                    store_api_calls(api_calls, project, request.user, "plain")
                    plain_text = clara_project_internal.load_text_version("plain")
                    form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text': plain_text, 'text_choice': 'manual'})
                    success = True
                except Exception as e:
                    api_error = f"An error occurred while generating the text. Please try again in a few minutes. Error details: {str(e)}"
                    form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text_choice': 'generate'})
            if not api_error:
                CLARAProjectAction.objects.create(
                    project=project,
                    action='edit' if existing_plain_text else 'create',
                    text_version='plain',
                    user=request.user
                )
    else:
        try:
            # Try to load the existing plain text, if it exists
            plain_text = clara_project_internal.load_text_version("plain")
            form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text': plain_text, 'text_choice': 'manual'})
        except FileNotFoundError:
            # If no plain text exists yet, initialize an empty form
            form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text_choice': 'generate'})

    return render(request, 'clara_app/create_plain_text.html', {'form': form, 'project': project, 'success': success, 'api_error': api_error})

My thought was to modify the branch where text_choice = 'generate' and delete all the other text versions, since they will be irrelevant and potentially confusing. Does this seem right to you?
ChatGPT
Yes, your idea to modify the create_plain_text view in the context of a cloned project is correct. Since the cloned project will have different language selections, the other text versions will be irrelevant and potentially confusing for the user.

In the branch where text_choice is 'generate', you can delete the other text versions using the delete_text_version method of the CLARAProjectInternal object. Here's an updated version of the view:

python
Copy code
@login_required
@user_is_project_owner
def create_plain_text(request, project_id):
    project = get_object_or_404(CLARAProject, pk=project_id)
    clara_project_internal = CLARAProjectInternal(project.internal_id, project.l2, project.l1)
    success = False
    api_error = None

    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = CreatePlainTextForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            existing_plain_text = clara_project_internal.text_versions["plain"]
            if form.cleaned_data['text_choice'] == 'manual':
                # User provided their own text
                clara_project_internal.save_text_version("plain", form.cleaned_data['text'])
            else:
                try:
                    api_calls = clara_project_internal.create_plain_text(form.cleaned_data['prompt'])
                    print(f'--- Created plain text: {len(api_calls)} API calls')
                    store_api_calls(api_calls, project, request.user, "plain")
                    plain_text = clara_project_internal.load_text_version("plain")
                    form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text': plain_text, 'text_choice': 'manual'})
                    success = True
                    # Delete other text versions in the cloned project
                    clara_project_internal.delete_text_version("segmented")
                    clara_project_internal.delete_text_version("gloss")
                    clara_project_internal.delete_text_version("lemma")
                    # Optionally, you can also delete the corresponding CLARAProjectAction objects
                    CLARAProjectAction.objects.filter(project=project, text_version__in=["segmented", "gloss", "lemma"]).delete()
                except Exception as e:
                    api_error = f"An error occurred while generating the text. Please try again in a few minutes. Error details: {str(e)}"
                    form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text_choice': 'generate'})
            if not api_error:
                CLARAProjectAction.objects.create(
                    project=project,
                    action='edit' if existing_plain_text else 'create',
                    text_version='plain',
                    user=request.user
                )
    else:
        try:
            # Try to load the existing plain text, if it exists
            plain_text = clara_project_internal.load_text_version("plain")
            form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text': plain_text, 'text_choice': 'manual'})
        except FileNotFoundError:
            # If no plain text exists yet, initialize an empty form
            form = CreatePlainTextForm(initial={'text_choice': 'generate'})

    return render(request, 'clara_app/create_plain_text.html', {'form': form, 'project': project, 'success': success, 'api_error': api_error})
With this modification, when the user chooses to generate the plain text for a cloned project, it will delete the segmented, glossed, and lemma text versions. This ensures that only the relevant text version remains for the cloned project.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!

We will need to add a delete_text_version method to CLARAProjectInternal. It will be similar to save_text_version:

    # Save one of the text files associated with the object and if necessary archive the old one
    def save_text_version(self, version: str, text: str) -> None:
        file_path = self._file_path_for_version(version)
        
        # Archive the old version, if it exists
        if file_path.exists():
            timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')
            archive_dir = self.project_dir / 'archive'
            archive_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
            archive_path = archive_dir / f'{version}_{timestamp}.txt'
            file_path.rename(archive_path)

        # Save the new version
        file_path.write_text(text, encoding="utf-8")
        self.text_versions[version] = str(file_path)
ChatGPT
That's correct! To implement the delete_text_version method in CLARAProjectInternal, you can use a similar approach to the save_text_version method. Here's an example implementation:

python
Copy code
import os

class CLARAProjectInternal:
    # ... existing code ...

    # Delete one of the text files associated with the object
    def delete_text_version(self, version: str) -> None:
        file_path = self._file_path_for_version(version)

        # Check if the file exists before deleting it
        if file_path.exists():
            file_path.unlink()

        # Remove the version from the text_versions dictionary
        if version in self.text_versions:
            del self.text_versions[version]
In the delete_text_version method, you can use the unlink method to delete the file associated with the given version. After deleting the file, you can remove the version entry from the text_versions dictionary.

Make sure to add this method to your CLARAProjectInternal class, and then you can use it in the create_plain_text view as shown in the previous example.
