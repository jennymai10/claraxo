
This file contains a short list of current and near-future priority
activities. It should be updated often, if possible at least twice
a week.

Last updated Nov 13 2023

CURRENTLY ACTIVE PRIORITIES

1. Integration of some version of "phonetic text" into C-LARA, porting
this functionality from the LARA code. Pauline Welby will be visiting
Adelaide Nov 22-25, and we said phonetic text would be the main item to
discuss.

2. Export/import of projects.

3. Integration of Melbourne Uni student projects.

4. Get more data on how C-LARA works with GPT-4 Turbo.

PROBABLY ACTIVE SOON

CONFERENCES
Prepare our presentation for "Literacy and Contemporary Society:
Creativity, Equity, Social Action", Dec 4-6.

BASIC FUNCTIONALITY
All of these should be fairly quick and straightforward. Perhaps 1-3 days of effort per task.
  - Basic online help
  - Password retrieval. Needs mail to be installed.
  - Payment integration

SOCIAL NETWORK 
All of these should also be fairly simple. Perhaps 1-3 days of effort per task.
  - Email notifications
  - Search function
  - Following/friending
  - Basic flagging and moderation functionality

DESIGN 
So far, C-LARA has no styling at all, we've just concentrated on getting the functionality into place.
Obviously this is an open-ended task, but putting in some basic CSS should have a very noticeable effect.
Rina suggested it might be good to pay for some standard template. I can ask Chat for advice here.

NEW FUNCTIONALITY
We have various kinds of new functionality that are either in progress or could be added reasonably quickly.
  - DALL-E-3. Integrating DALL-E-3 is probably only a day or so of work, and again one imagines many people would like this functionality.
  - Reading histories. This idea from LARA can probably be reimplemented in C-LARA with 2-3 days of work.
  - Manual Text/Audio alignment. The Melbourne Uni student team nearly had this integrated before they handed over to me. Perhaps 1-2 days of work.
  - Audio recording. I'm guessing the Melbourne Uni project can be integrated in 2-3 days.
  - Annotated images.  Unfortunately, this Melbourne Uni project looks harder to integrate. Their solution is not exactly compatible with C-LARA and needs some adjustment.
  - Automatic Text/Audio alignment. This Melbourne Uni project also requires nontrivial effort to use. We may want to consider integrating the LARA version instead.
  - Flashcards. Another Melbourne Uni project that requires some effort to integrate, right now not clear how much.

MULTI-WORD EXPRESSIONS
We keep mentioning this, but nothing has happened.
I did notice however that things seems to be considerably better with GPT-4 Turbo. A first step would be to evaluate more carefully how Turbo is doing so that we can reassess.

LOGGING
Logging is an open-ended problem. There are many ways to do it - some simple ones will be quick to implement. Many people want it for running experiments. We should discuss

PLUG-INS

- Ongoing email discussion with Denis about AskTheCode plugin.
  No deadline but frequent exchanges.

- Ongoing discussion with Papr Memory about their memory plugin.
  They think it should be possible for users to share memories,
  which could have important implications for C-LARA.
  No deadline but frequent exchanges.
