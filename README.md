# Clara Tic Tac Toe Project

This project is a Django-based web application that includes a Tic Tac Toe game interface and a RESTful API using Django Rest Framework (DRF). It also integrates with GPT-4 API for AI-based gameplay.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.11 (other versions may work, but this is the recommended version)
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git (for version control)

## Project Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/clara-tictactoe.git
cd clara-tictactoe
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory to store your environment variables. Use the following template:

```env
DJANGO_DEBUG=True
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
CLARA_ENVIRONMENT=local
CLARA=/path/to/clara_directory
FILE_STORAGE_TYPE=local
DB_TYPE=sqlite
```

Replace `/path/to/clara_directory` with the actual path to your project directory.

### 5. Apply Migrations

Apply the database migrations to set up your database schema:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 6. Create a Superuser

To access the Django admin interface, create a superuser:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to create your admin user.

### 7. Running the Development Server

You need to start both the Q-cluster and the Django development server.

#### Terminal 1: Start the Q-cluster

```bash
python manage.py qcluster
```

#### Terminal 2: Start the Django Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### 8. Access the Application

Open your web browser and go to:

- The Tic Tac Toe interface: `http://localhost:8000/tictactoe/`
- The Django admin: `http://localhost:8000/admin/`

### 9. API Endpoints

The RESTful API can be accessed at:

```plaintext
http://localhost:8000/api/games/
```

### 10. Frontend Development (Optional)

If you plan to develop the frontend separately, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

### 11. Committing Changes

Before committing changes to the repository, ensure the `.gitignore` file excludes unnecessary files, such as:

```plaintext
# Python
*.pyc
__pycache__/

# Virtual Environment
venv/

# Environment Variables
.env

# Django Stuff
*.log
staticfiles/
mediafiles/
```

### 12. Deploying to Production

For deployment, you will need to set environment variables in your production environment (e.g., using Heroku or another platform) and switch the `CLARA_ENVIRONMENT` to `heroku`.
