Annotate the following {l2_language} text,
dividing it up in a natural way into pages, and each page into sentence-like segments. 

Pages are separated using instances of the <page> tag.

Segments are separated using instance of a double bar, ||.

Also, if a word in the text is composed of smaller words, separate them with vertical bars,
and if a multi-word expression is better treated as a single unit, enclose it inside @ signs.

Here are some French examples:

The output will be read by a Python script, so produce just the text without any comments or introduction.
