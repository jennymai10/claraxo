I am going to give you a short passage in {l2_language}, annotated with root forms and presented in a JSON format.

The JSON is a list of pairs. The first element of each pair is a {l2_language} word/punctuation mark and the second should be the root form.

Please read the annotated passage and reproduce it in the same JSON format, keeping the words/punctuation marks the same
but correcting any root forms that appear to be incorrect.

In particular, if two or more words (possibly with other words in between) appear to be a multi-word expression,
make the root form annotating each component word be the whole multi-word expression.

For example, in English you might correct

{examples}

Here is the JSON to correct:

{simplified_elements_json}

Write out just the corrected JSON with no introduction or comments, since it will be processed by a Python script.
