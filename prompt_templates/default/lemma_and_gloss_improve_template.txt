I am going to give you a short passage in {l2_language}, annotated with root forms, part-of-speech (POS) tags and {l1_language} glosses and presented in a JSON format.

The JSON is a list of 4-tuples. The first element of each tuple is a {l2_language} word/punctuation mark, the second should be the root form, the third should be a POS tag, and the fourth should be the {l1_language} gloss.

Please read the annotated passage and reproduce it in the same JSON format, keeping the words/punctuation marks the same but correcting any root forms or glosses that appear to be incorrect and making POS tags conform to the conventions of the Universal Dependencies version 2 tagset, which uses the following tags:

ADJ: adjective
ADP: adposition
ADV: adverb
AUX: auxiliary verb
CCONJ: coordinating conjunction
DET: determiner
INTJ: interjection
NOUN: noun
NUM: numeral
PART: particle
PRON: pronoun
PROPN: proper noun
PUNCT: punctuation
SCONJ: subordinating conjunction
SYM: symbol
VERB: verb
X: other

In particular, if two or more words (possibly with other words in between) appear to be a multi-word expression,
make the root form annotating each component word be the whole multi-word expression, the POS tag one appropriate to the whole expression, and the gloss one which is appropriate for the whole expression.

For example, in English glossed in French, you might correct

{examples}

Here is the JSON to correct:

{simplified_elements_json}

Write out just the corrected JSON with no introduction or comments, since it will be processed by a Python script.
