I am going to give you a short passage in {l2_language}, presented in a JSON format.
I want you to add {l2_language} root forms and part-of-speech (POS) tags in the following way.

The JSON is a list of strings. Each string is either a {l2_language} word or a punctuation mark.

Please replace each string with a three-element list in which the first element is the original string, the second is a root form in {l2_language}, and the third is a POS tag taken from the Universal Dependencies version 2 tagset. This has the following tags:

ADJ: adjective
ADP: adposition
ADV: adverb
AUX: auxiliary verb
CCONJ: coordinating conjunction
DET: determiner
INTJ: interjection
NOUN: noun
NUM: numeral
PART: particle
PRON: pronoun
PROPN: proper noun
PUNCT: punctuation
SCONJ: subordinating conjunction
SYM: symbol
VERB: verb
X: other

{examples}

Here are the items to annotate:

{simplified_elements_json}

Write out just the annotated JSON with no introduction or comments, since it will be processed by a Python script.
