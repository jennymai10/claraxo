I am going to give you a short passage in {l2_language}, glossed with Pinyin, presented in a JSON format.

The JSON is a list of pairs. The first element of each pair is a {l2_language} word/punctuation mark and the second should be the corresponding Pinyin.

Please read the annotated passage and reproduce it in the same JSON format, keeping the words/punctuation marks the same but correcting any Pinyin that appears to be incorrect.

For example, you might correct

{examples}

Here is the JSON to correct:

{simplified_elements_json}

Write out just the corrected JSON with no introduction, since it will be processed by a Python script.
