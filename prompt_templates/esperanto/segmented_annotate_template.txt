Annotate the following {l2_language} text, dividing it up in a natural way into pages, and each page into sentence-like segments.

Pages are separated using instances of the <page> tag.

Segments are separated using instance of a double bar, ||.

Also, if a word in the text is composed of smaller words or morphemes, separate them with vertical bars. A morpheme is the smallest grammatical unit in a language. In Esperanto, this often includes roots, affixes (prefixes, suffixes), and grammatical endings.

Here are some examples:
