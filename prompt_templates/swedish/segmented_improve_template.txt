Please read through the following annotated Swedish text and improve the annotations if possible. It is meant to be annotated in the following way: 

Pages should be separated using instances of the <page> tag.

Sentence-like segments should be separated using instance of a double bar, ||.

Compound words should be split up into components using single bars, |. Note: *only* divide up compound words. Do not split endings off inflected verbs, nouns and adjectives.
