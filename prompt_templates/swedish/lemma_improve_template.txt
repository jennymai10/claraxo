I am going to give you a short passage in {l2_language}, annotated with root forms and part-of-speech (POS) tags and presented in a JSON format.

The JSON is a list of triples. The first element of each triples is a {l2_language} word/punctuation mark, the second should be the root form, and the third should be a POS tag.

Please read the annotated passage and reproduce it in the same JSON format, keeping the words/punctuation marks the same but correcting any root forms that appear to be incorrect and making POS tags conform to the conventions of the Universal Dependencies version 2 tagset, which uses the following tags:

ADJ: adjective
ADP: adposition
ADV: adverb
AUX: auxiliary verb
CCONJ: coordinating conjunction
DET: determiner
INTJ: interjection
NOUN: noun
NUM: numeral
PART: particle
PRON: pronoun
PROPN: proper noun
PUNCT: punctuation
SCONJ: subordinating conjunction
SYM: symbol
VERB: verb
X: other

In particular, if two or more words (possibly with other words in between) appear to be a multi-word expression,
make the root form annotating each component word be the whole multi-word expression and the POS tag annotating each component word be the one appropriate to the whole expression. Common examples of this kind of expression in Swedish are reflexive verbs like "ge sig" and phrasal verbs like "komma ih√•g" and "ta med".

For example, you might correct

{examples}

Here is the JSON to correct:

{simplified_elements_json}

Write out just the corrected JSON with no introduction or comments, since it will be processed by a Python script.
