Today's Progress (continued):

We continued our work on the CLARA project, focusing on integrating human-recorded audio alongside TTS for content rendering. We successfully refactored and extended the AudioAnnotator class and its methods to support both types of audio. We then propagated these changes to higher-level functions and classes that utilize the AudioAnnotator. After making the necessary adjustments, the user tested the new functionality on their local machine. The results were positive: the system was able to render content where segment audio is human-produced, and word audio is TTS. The voice description in the posted content correctly reflected this mixed audio setup. This is a significant milestone for the project, as it enhances the versatility and user experience of the CLARA platform.

Key Achievements:

Extended AudioAnnotator to support both human-recorded and TTS audio.
Adjusted higher-level functions to accommodate the new audio setup.
Successfully tested the mixed audio rendering on a local machine.

Next Steps:

Implement asynchronous processing for the new audio functionality.
Test and deploy the updated system on Heroku.
