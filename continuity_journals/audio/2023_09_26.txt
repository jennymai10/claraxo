Task Overview:

We embarked on the task of incorporating human-recorded audio into C-LARA as an alternative to the existing Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality. The goal was to allow for a richer and more natural audio experience for users, especially in contexts where human voice could provide a more authentic and engaging experience.

Key Developments:

1. Audio Processing Method:

We reviewed and refined the method process_lite_dev_tools_zipfile in the AudioAnnotator class. This method processes a zip file containing audio data from LiteDevTools, extracts the audio files, and prepares them for integration into C-LARA.
Several iterations were made to handle exceptions, manage temporary directories, and ensure the smooth conversion of audio files from .wav to .mp3 format.

2. Audio Conversion:

The function convert_ldt_data_to_mp3 was developed to handle the conversion of audio files. It uses the ffmpeg tool to convert .wav files to .mp3 format, updating the metadata accordingly.

3. Integration with C-LARA:

Modifications were made to the render_text_start function to check for the presence of human audio and use it during the rendering process if available.
The HumanAudioInfo model was referenced to determine if human audio is available for a particular project and, if so, to fetch the relevant voice talent ID.

Challenges and Solutions:

We encountered challenges related to missing imports, which were resolved.
There were issues with passing multiple values for the 'callback' argument in the _store_existing_mp3s method. This was addressed by correcting the method invocation.

Next Steps:

Further testing and validation of the human audio integration process.
Optimization and refinement of the audio processing workflow.
Exploration of additional features and enhancements related to human audio in C-LARA.
