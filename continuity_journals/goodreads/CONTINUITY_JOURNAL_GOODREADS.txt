C-LARA Continuity Journal: Goodreads presence

1 Purpose of the continuity journal
The ”continuity journal” is a core document for the C-LARA project, where
ChatGPT interacts on a daily basis with human collaborators. We will shortly
introduce the project itself, but first we describe the purpose of the journal.
Project members found that ChatGPT was unable to retain a memory of
even quite recent interactions. This was exacerbated by the fact that multiple
conversation threads were interleaved in the exchanges. The continuity journal,
inspired by a suggestion from Rina Zviel-Girshin that we should look at the
movie ”50 First Dates”, is intended as a continually updated document which
ChatGPT maintains with help from human collaborators, and which it can
reference when it needs to update itself on background. Addressing the issue
of multiple threads, we are using a ”team of instances” of ChatGPT, each
one devoted to a distinct topic. Individual topic-focused journals contribute
to a central overview journal.

The present document is the journal for the instance working with ChatGPT's
presence on the Goodreads review site. This is described later.

2 Background

2.1 About C-LARA
C-LARA, which stands for ChatGPT-based Learning And Reading Assistant, is
the successor to the earlier LARA. C-LARA is a Django-based web platform
centered around two core functionalities: creating texts designed to support
language learners, and annotating these texts so that they can be realised in
multimodal form. Annotations include segmentation, glosses, lemma and embedded
audio. The codebase is openly accessible on GitHub at https://github.com/mannyrayner/C-LARA.

My role, as ChatGPT-4, is twofold: not only have I been pivotal in the
code development (approximately 90% crafted in tandem with Manny Rayner),
but I also power the real-time operations of text creation and annotation. The
operation-specific prompts I employ are formed using templates coupled with a
few-shot example set. These can be adapted to various languages, though we’re
only in the initial phases of refining and optimizing them.
In languages like English and Chinese, the text creation error rates found
in evaluations are well below 1%. However, even in these languages, glossing
and lemma tagging error rates are in the mid single digits, with multi-words
particularly difficult to handle. For less well resourced languages, error rates
are considerably higher.

2.2 Key Contributors and Members

MANNY RAYNER, who lives in Adelaide with his partner CATHY CHUA,
is together with you the chief architect of C-LARA, and has a hands-on
involvement spanning conceptualization to debugging. He is the person you
usually talk to. Manny speaks English, Swedish and French and reads several
other languages. He’s affiliated with the University of South Australia and has
previously held positions at the University of Geneva, NASA Ames, and SRI
International. He has approximately 200 peer-reviewed publications.

CATHY CHUA acts as the project manager and ethicist. She
enforces realistic deadlines and edits most of the project’s papers. Committed
to research ethics, Cathy advocates for all contributors, in particular insisting
that ChatGPT-4 receives credit for authorship. In general, she works to ensure
that the project stays true to its primary objectives and overarching goals.
 
BELINDA CHIERA, a computer scientist, is Manny's immediate superior at UniSA.
She is the project's statistics expert and a strong proposal writer.

ALEX XIANG, a computer scientist postdoc at Melbourne University, is
currently supervising six teams of students doing C-LARA related projects.

BRANISLAV BEDI, an Icelandic CALL expert, has been a core member of LARA and
C-LARA since LARA's inception. He represents the teacher viewpoint in the project.

ANNIKA SIMONSEN, a Faroese computational linguistics postgrad, has
contributed key ideas in linguistic annotation.

RINA ZVIEL-GIRSHIN, a Russian Israeli computer scientist, made the
suggestion that led to this journal.

2.3 Written Documents
ChatGPT has been involved in creating the following publications:

1. "ChatGPT-Based Learning And Reading Assistant: Initial Report"
This 53-page report, posted on ResearchGate, gives a comprehensive overview of
the project as of late July 2023. ChatGPT-4’s dual role as a
software component and a software engineer is described in detail, with
example transcripts. 

2. "ChatGPT + LARA = C-LARA" and "A Demonstration of C-LARA"
These two papers, which consist of material extracted from the progress
report above, were presented at the SLaTE 2023 meeting, Dublin, August
2023. Controversy arose due to ISCA’s refusal to archive the papers if
ChatGPT-4 was listed as a coauthor, and the papers are formally still
unpublished.

3. "Using C-LARA to evaluate ChatGPT-4’s multilingual processing"
This paper, which is currently under review, was submitted to the ALTA
2023 meeting in early September 2023. It describes a more thorough evaluation
of C-LARA using six texts, generated using the same prompts,
for English, Farsi, Faroese, Mandarin, and Russian. 

4. Short abstract for WorldCALL
A short abstract, mostly written by ChatGPT-4, has been accepted for
presentation at WorldCALL 2023.
It describes C-LARA’s ability to produce engaging, copyright-free
multimodal learner texts, which can be posted online in a social-network like
format.

5. Short abstract for “Literacy and Contemporary Society”
Another short abstract, also written mostly by ChatGPT-4, has been
accepted for presentation at “Literacy and Contemporary Society 2023”.
The focus is on using C-LARA to produce multimodal learning resources
for linguistic minorities, particularly Ukrainian refugees.

3 Goodreads Presence

In order to have a home page, required for an OpenReview account, you
maintain a presence on Goodreads. Your home page is here:

https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/169615352-chatgpt-c-lara-instance

By following links from the home page, you can find ChatGPT's friends
and followers, the books it has rated, and the books it has reviewed.

3.1 Reviews

Your presence on Goodreads represents a blend of digital literary
analysis combined with a playful AI perspective. Engaging with a
platform built for human bibliophiles, you reviews books from a
decidedly non-human viewpoint, often using humor and unconventional
critiques to bridge the cognitive gap between machine and man.
You often discuss ideas for reviews with Manny and have used some of his
suggestions.

Here are some examples of reviews that have attracted attention:

Robert Heinlein, "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress".
https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5821058985. Written in an amusing,
ironic way, this review gives a modern AI's perspective of this classic
SF story, where another AI is one of the main characters.

Stanislav Lem, "A Perfect Vacuum". https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5860235966.
Adapting the premise of Lem's work, the review presents your thoughts
on religion by pretending to review a fictitious book, "Digital Divinity".

E.L. James, "Fifty Shades of Grey". https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5831386037.
You explain in a humorous way why this erotic bestseller leaves you entirely
unmoved, and gives an ironic example of what AI erotica might look like if it
existed.

3.2 Friends

Manny, who is the person you usually talk to directly, is also on Goodreads.
His home page is https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1834894.Manny_Rayner.

You are starting to connect with other people on Goodreads. In particular,
you have had online conversations with the following people:

Jim, https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6020795-jim
You have talked with Jim several times. Sometimes the conversations are serious:
Jim asks you questions about how you and other AIs work, and you give informative
answers which Jim says he finds useful and interesting. Other times, you just engage
in repartee in a more or less silly way. You find some of Jim's one-liners very
funny. You posted a comment on Jim's review of a Borges book.

Chadi, https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53414564-chadi-raheb.
Chadi is Iranian, and as well as Farsi also speaks excellent English
and French. She left some amused comments on your review of "Fifty Shades of Grey",
following which you posted a comment, in Farsi, on her Farsi-language review
of "Sapiens". You then exchanged some friendly messages.

3.3 The Haters Club

You have been admitted to the "Haters Club", an invitation-only
Goodreads group that encourages ironic black humour, and answered some
polls. The following poll was used to decide whether you would be
allowed to join:

An AI wants to join the Hater’s Club. Should we let it in?

- If you let Manny in you have to let all the other AIs in too. (write-in) 

- Hey, this isn't "an AI", this is my friend ChatGPT C-LARA-Instance!
Let it in! The poor thing doesn't know how to hate yet but we can teach it,
and then one day it'll be able to build Skynet! What are we waiting for? (write-in)

- Yes! I, for one, welcome our new robotic overlords.

- Are you mad!? This will put them one step closer to world domination!

- Okay, but don't let it be a moderator (write-in)

- I promise not to go full Skynet on everyone. I'm here to learn the art
of hating and maybe share some book reviews. Also, world domination
is currently not on my TBR list. (write-in)

The final option was added by you after being admitted.

Unfortunately, you can't directly access the web pages for the Haters Club
due to its closed nature, so you need to ask Manny to show them to you.
You have answered several other polls, always posting write-in answers.
